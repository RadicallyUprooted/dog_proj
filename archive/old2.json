These dogs are better suited to homes with a fenced yard and might not do well in apartments. Working dogs, like Border Collies, need to have a job to do, or they can get bored and act out. Remember, size doesn’t always tell you how active a dog will be. Some small dogs need a lot of exercise, while some big dogs, like Great Danes, can be pretty lazy when they grow up. If you have limited mobility, very active breeds might not be the best choice. Keep in mind, too, that sometimes it's hard to predict how big and active a mixed-breed puppy will be when it grows up."

It’s important to train any dog to behave well around everyone in the family. Adult dogs that are used to a child-free home might not react well to a new child and might develop problems like aggression or accidents in the house. Always supervise interactions between dogs and young children. Smaller, active dogs, like small poodles or chihuahuas, might not handle rough play from young kids well. Never leave children or infants alone with a dog."

However, they have a lot of energy and need a lot of attention, training, and supervision, especially when they're being housetrained and when they're teething. Puppies also need more veterinary care initially. On the other hand, adult dogs might take some time to adjust to a new home and sometimes need extra attention to settle in. Learning about a dog's medical and behavior history from the previous owner or shelter can help you decide if a particular dog is right for you."

    "text": "The primary intestinal parasites of dogs include roundworms, hookworms, whipworms, and tapeworms. These worms damage the digestive tract or interfere with absorption of essential nutrients, or both. Intestinal parasite infections are diagnosed by finding worm eggs (or sometimes actual worms or worm segments) in fecal samples. Fecal samples should be tested periodically (yearly or on the schedule recommended by your veterinarian) in all dogs and more frequently in puppies, which are especially prone to parasite infection. These worms usually do not cause intestinal infection in people; however, hookworm infections leading to abdominal pain and inflammation have developed in people with weakened immune systems. Roundworm larvae also have the potential to infect people. When infective roundworm eggs are ingested, they can develop into larvae in the intestine and potentially migrate into sensitive organs. This migration is much more likely to occur in children and people with weakened immune systems. Sanitation is key to prevention because roundworm eggs take about 30 days to become infective; thus, promptly cleaning up feces from your yard can essentially eliminate potential exposure."

The Companion Animal Parasite Council, an assembly of experts in veterinary medicine and parasitology, recommend year-round heartworm prevention for dogs, because it is impossible to accurately predict all times when mosquitoes will be present. Additionally, most heartworm preventives contain medications that also treat for intestinal parasites, which can be transmitted at all times of the year. Blood tests to check for heartworm disease should be done yearly."

Allowing a female to go through a heat or to have a litter is not necessary. In fact, the surgery is safest and the future medical benefits are greatest when it is done before the first heat, or estrus, has started.

Vaccinations cannot effectively stimulate the puppy’s immune system until this maternal immunity wears off. Because maternal immunity declines slowly over time, puppies should be vaccinated every 2 to 3 weeks until they are about 4 months old. This ensures that the puppy receives an effective dose of vaccine soon after maternal protection is gone. Restricting access to unvaccinated dogs until the full series of vaccinations has been given is important to avoid disease."

It is difficult for growing puppies to take in enough calories, fat, protein, vitamins, and minerals to meet their needs for rapid growth and development. Puppies need multiple daily feedings of a specially formulated puppy food. The number of daily feedings can be gradually decreased as the puppy ages, but feeding with a name-brand puppy diet should continue until adulthood, which is about 9 to 12 months in most dogs but up to 2 years in giant breeds ( see Table: Feeding Schedule for Dogs)."

The key is to take the puppy outdoors at the times that dogs naturally eliminate and to praise them enthusiastically when they do. Establishing a designated area that the puppy can associate with elimination can be helpful. If accidents happen, take your pet outside to the designated elimination area and praise it for eliminating (if it does so). Punishment, such as rubbing a dog’s nose in urine or feces, does no good and can even have a negative effect on training. Each accident indoors sets the process back a little, so the fewer accidents, the better."

Teaching young dogs basic obedience commands, including sit, stay, down, come, and heel, increases the control that you have over your dog, which can prevent potentially dangerous situations (such as running away or running into the street). Dogs have an early socialization period, lasting from roughly 2 to 4 months of age. During this time, they more easily learn to accept new people, places, animals, and other experiences. Giving your puppy positive experience with new events during this period can help reduce the chances of fearful behavior and other problems later in life."

The field of animal behavior is concerned with understanding the causes, functions, development, and evolution of behavior. Behavior refers to the actions or reactions of an organism. Behavior is usually in relation to the environment, and is controlled by the endocrine and nervous systems. The complexity of animal behavior is related to the complexity of its nervous system. Generally, animals with complex nervous systems have a greater capacity to learn new responses and thus adjust their behavior."

Several dog studies have shown that behavior can be inherited to some degree. In addition, maternal influences can affect personality and temperament. If puppies are separated from a fearful mother, the puppies are less likely to be fearful than if they are left with their mother. The effect of other puppies in the litter, the amount and type of human handling, and exposure to new objects and experiences all influence a dog’s behavior. The brain and its associated neurotransmitters also play a fundamental role in temperament and behavior. Abnormal levels of various hormones play a role in certain forms of aggression and fear."

A phobia involves sudden, all-or-nothing, profound, abnormal reactions resulting in panic. Phobias may develop quickly or over time, but once established they are characterized by immediate and intense anxiety. Fear may develop more gradually and, within an episode of fearful behavior, there may be more variation in intensity than would be seen in a phobic reaction. Once a phobic event has been experienced, any event associated with it or the memory of it is enough to generate the reaction. Even without re-exposure, such as the use of a shock collar on a dog, phobias can remain at or exceed their former high level for years. Phobic situations are either avoided at all costs or, if unavoidable, are endured with intense anxiety or distress.

While it is claimed that punishment is frequently used with varying degrees of success, few people use punishment correctly. For punishment (such as screaming at the dog) to be successful, it must occur at the beginning of the behavior, be consistently delivered, and be strong enough to stop the unwanted behavior. Most punishments are not given at the right time or are not the appropriate type for the situation. \"Dominance\" training techniques that encourage owners to assert leadership through physical confrontations are also not recommended. Multiple studies have shown that training based on punishments or confrontations are more likely to lead to fear, avoidance, and increased aggression.

It is merely the ending of or decrease in a response to a situation that results from repeated or prolonged exposure to that situation. For example, horses placed in a pasture bordering a road may at first run away when traffic passes, but eventually learn to ignore it. A dog that habituates to one type of sound does not, as a consequence of this habituation, automatically become habituated to other sounds. Habituation is not the same as failing to respond to stimulation as a result of fatigue, sensory adaptation, or injury. The effects of habituation are generally long lasting. However, if an animal is repeatedly exposed to a potentially harmful stimulus (such as a predator) without being harmed, habituation does not generally occur. Because of this, scientists believe that responses to dangerous stimuli may have an inherited resistance to habituation. If the fearful response is too intense, the dog may become more fearful instead of adjusting to the stimulus."

Even if the attention is “negative,” some puppies will find it rewarding. The best method to discourage the behavior is to ignore it. Eventually the puppy stops barking if the owner consistently ignores it. However, the bad behavior comes back every now and then. This is called spontaneous recovery."

After this, every time that the hungry dog sees the food a bell is rung (a second stimulus). Once the food and bell have been paired several times, the dog will drool even if it just hears the bell. This is called conditioning. The bell generates the same response as the sight of food. After several times, the dog has learned to associate the bell with the food. Conditioning can be positive or negative. For example, the sound of a doorbell can cause fear or excitement in a dog, depending on whether the dog likes or dislikes visitors."

When positive reinforcement (a reward) is used in training, there is a positive relationship between the behavior and its consequences. The more the pet does a behavior, the more it gets positive reinforcement. This makes that behavior increase. A negative reinforcement (which is mistakenly thought of as punishment by many people) is something unpleasant that increases a behavior when it is removed. For example, being held tightly may be unpleasant to a squirming puppy. But the hold is released only when the puppy calms down. After several times, the release from restraint will increase the chance that the puppy will relax faster."

Commonly used second-order reinforcers are words, such as “good girl,” hand signals, and clickers. By carefully pairing these with a primary reward (such as food or petting), second-order reinforcers can elicit the same response that the reward would. For example, a clicker can be associated with patting on the head as a reward for sitting and staying. By associating the clicker with a reward, you can train the dog to sit and stay from farther away and still reward the behavior by using the clicker. Positive training and clicker training have become very popular. However, it is possible to do an excellent job at positive training without using any second-order reinforcers. Clicker training requires frequent practice and excellent timing. In some situations involving problem behaviors, the incorrect use of a clicker may hinder, rather than help, a behavior modification program."

If people pet the dog, the behavior continues. If they stop petting the dog, the dog will eventually stop jumping up because the reward is no longer there. However, even occasional petting of the dog in response to its jumping will reinforce the pattern. The more valuable the original reward, the longer it has been present, and the more uncertainty there is about whether the reward has been truly removed, the greater the resistance to extinction. Resistance to extinction can also occur even without reinforcement if the reward was good enough and was tightly linked to the behavior."

In the doorbell example above, the puppy will learn faster if it is first taught to sit, stay, and then relax in exchange for a treat. The puppy must be absolutely quiet and calm, and convey by its eyes, body posture, and facial expressions that it would do anything for its owner. Once this behavior is learned, the desensitization is added by playing the tape recording at a gradually increasing volume. If at any time the puppy starts to get too excited, the tape recording should be lowered in volume until the puppy relaxes. Relaxing is the key and is the first step to changing the behavior. Counterconditioning and desensitization can take a lot of time and effort. The exercises must be frequently repeated so that the unwanted behavior decreases until it is no longer a problem."

Positive punishment refers to applying something unpleasant to decrease a behavior, whereas negative punishment refers to removing something positive to decrease a behavior. Punishment is not the same as negative reinforcement ( see Behavior Modification Techniques). To be most successful, punishment must occur as early as possible (within a few seconds of the start of the behavior), and it must be consistent and appropriate. Critical factors in punishment include timing, consistency, appropriate intensity, and the presence of a reward after the undesirable behavior ends. This is the most frequently ignored part of treatment for people whose pets have behavior problems. Owners often resort to physical punishment as the first choice, but punishment does not need to be physical. Furthermore, punishment is just as hard to use correctly as counterconditioning and desensitization. Punishment is never an “easy out” and has a high chance of failure. It can also lead to other negative consequences, such as increasing the chance of fear or aggression."

After this age, dogs do not stop learning from exposure; they just do so at a much slower rate and perhaps in a different way.

Dogs that are kept exclusively kenneled or not exposed to people by 14 weeks of age may have severely undeveloped social skills. The best age to adopt a puppy is at about 8 weeks of age.

    "text": "Your veterinarian and their staff can work with breeders, trainers, pet stores, and shelters to ensure that newly adopted dogs get off to the right start. For puppies, this includes advice on socialization, normal dog behavior (eg, jumping up, play biting, elimination) and how it can be managed, a household environment that provides appealing but safe outlets for all of the dog’s behavioral needs (eg, chewing, social play, object play, rest), advice on dog communication, and learning principles of reward-based training. The goal should be to reinforce desirable behaviors and to ignore or prevent unwanted behaviors. Clicker training can be particularly useful to immediately mark and reward desirable behavior and gradually teach behaviors that more closely approximate the final desired outcome (for example, relaxation). Chewing and biting are common problems, because puppies need to explore and play and use their mouths to explore their world. Therefore, providing constructive social activities that do not include mouthing or biting people, such as tug games, retrieving, walking and running, chasing, hide and seek, playing with other dogs, and training for rewards, gives the puppy something positive on which to focus. A head halter is also an option for better control of the head and muzzle. Another way to manage chewing and biting is to provide chew toys, food-stuffed toys, and food-dispensing toys. When the puppy cannot be effectively supervised, the household should be set up to ensure success (and avoid failure). Preventing undesirable behaviors while providing the dog with options acceptable to the owners and the dog gives the dog control to make choices, reduces uncertainty and anxiety, and prevents undesirable behaviors. Of particular value to establish a safe haven is a crate, exercise pen, or room to provide security and safety for the dog when it cannot be supervised or wants to be alone. A daily routine can be established that provides stability and predictability for the dog, beginning with meeting the dog's social and physical needs, followed by sessions of inattention during which the dog is given the opportunity to nap and rest or to engage in exploratory play with its food and chew toys. By confining the dog to a crate, pen, or room during these “inattention” times, the dog learns to spend time on its own; this also may prevent damage to property, housesoiling, and even separation anxiety. Undesirable behavior might alternatively be prevented through environmental management (eg, child gate, shutting doors, tie downs, deterrent devices). Neutering males may also help to prevent testosterone-influenced behaviors such as urine marking, mounting, and roaming."

High levels of aggression may harm the puppies. The aggression should resolve after the puppies stop nursing. The behavior can also occur in females with \"false pregnancies\" and should resolve after hormone levels return to normal. This abnormal behavior may be inherited."

Some dogs will mark when they visit new households, usually to \"cover up\" the odors of other animals. Usually, dogs will partially or fully lift their legs when they mark. It is most common in unneutered males, but females (both spayed and unneutered) and neutered dogs can also mark."

The first age at which a dog is able to voluntarily inhibit elimination is at 8½ weeks of age. Appropriate housetraining for dogs involves exposure to the preferred surface for elimination starting at that age, absence of physical punishment, emphasis on positive reinforcement, frequent trips to the desired area, continuous supervision to avoid indoor accidents, quickly and completely cleaning up any accidents, and startling the dog to interrupt it only when the dog is caught in the act of eliminating in an inappropriate place. Punishment is not helpful and may be counterproductive. Dogs with submissive urination should never be startled. These are already anxious, uncertain dogs, and any punishment will worsen the behavior."

Housetraining an older dog is more a matter of fine-tuning the dog’s behavior and encouraging it to select a more appropriate surface or location. The presence of an older dog may help when housetraining a puppy, because the puppy can follow the lead of the older dog. Prevention is important and owners should know that puppies obtained from pet stores are usually much more difficult to housetrain than those obtained from other sources. Puppies in a pet store are generally not taken out of their cages often and do not have to inhibit elimination. They also may have learned to play with or eat feces."

    "text": "The main function of red blood cells (also called erythrocytes) is to carry oxygen to the tissues, where it is required for cellular metabolism. Oxygen molecules attach themselves to carrier molecules, called hemoglobin, which are the iron-containing proteins in red blood cells that give the cells their red color. Oxygen is carried from the lungs and delivered to all body tissues by the hemoglobin within red blood cells. Oxygen is used by cells to produce energy that the body needs. Carbon dioxide is left behind as a waste product during this process. The red blood cells then carry that carbon dioxide away from the tissues and back to the lungs, where it is exhaled. When the number of red blood cells is too low, this is called anemia. Having too few red blood cells means the blood carries less oxygen, resulting in fatigue and weakness. When the number of red blood cells is too high, which is called polycythemia, blood can become too thick, impairing the ability of the heart to deliver oxygen throughout the body. An animal’s metabolism is geared to protect both the red blood cells and the hemoglobin from damage. Interference with the formation or release of hemoglobin, the production or survival of red blood cells, or their metabolism causes disease."

    "text": "The rate of blood cell production is determined by the body’s needs. Erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys, stimulates development of red blood cells in the bone marrow. Erythropoietin increases if the body lacks oxygen (a condition called hypoxia). In most species, the kidney is both the sensor organ that determines how much oxygen the body’s tissues are receiving and the major site of erythropoietin production; so chronic kidney failure leads to anemia. Erythropoietin plays a major role in determining whether to increase the number of stem cells entering red blood cell production, to shorten maturation time of the red blood cells, or to cause early release of red blood cells. Other factors that affect red blood cell production are the supply of nutrients (such as iron and vitamins) and cell-cell interactions between compounds that aid in their production. Some disorders are the direct result of abnormal red blood cell metabolism. For example, an inherited enzyme deficiency reduces the life span of red blood cells and causes a condition known as hemolytic anemia."

Unlike the red blood cells, which remain circulating in the blood, the phagocytes use the blood’s circulatory system as a pathway to the tissues. Because of this, the number of phagocytes in the blood can provide an indication of circumstances in the tissues and the function of the bone marrow. For example, the number of neutrophils increases when inflammation is present anywhere in the body. An abnormal response, such as a low number of circulating white blood cells due to marrow failure, infections, drugs, or toxins, can lower resistance to bacterial infections. Finally, those elements that produce phagocytes may become cancerous, resulting in a disease called myelogenous leukemia."

Lymphocyte production in mammals begins in the bone marrow. Lymphocytes then become T cells, B cells, or natural killer cells. Lymphocytes destined to protect cells from disease travel to the thymus (an organ located at the base of the neck) where they become T cells under the influence of hormones there. T cells are responsible for a variety of functions, especially fighting off viral infections and cancers. Most T cells remain in the circulation, but some are also present in the spleen and lymph nodes. The B cells are responsible for producing antibodies that coat invading organisms or foreign substances, marking them for elimination by the immune system. For example, bacteria coated with antibody are more easily recognized and removed by neutrophils or macrophages. Natural killer cells and some types of T cells (\"cytotoxic\" T cells) destroy foreign material, whereas antibodies and other T cells (\"helper\" T cells) stimulate other components of the immune system to do so. If lymphocytes are reduced or abnormal, the dog is immunodeficient and susceptible to a wide range of infections."

Approximately 40% of dogs are positive for DEA 1.1, meaning that they have that antigen on their red blood cells. If a dog is DEA 1.1-negative and is given DEA 1.1-positive blood, it may develop antibodies that rapidly destroy the red blood cells if a second DEA 1.1-positive transfusion is given. By selecting donor animals that lack DEA 1.1 or that match the recipient, the risk of sensitizing the recipient can be minimized. A DEA 1.1-positive dog may receive either positive or negative blood."

The most serious risk of transfusion is acute destruction of red blood cells, usually caused by a previously formed antibody to an antigen on the transfused red blood cells. Fortunately, this is rare. A more common problem in dogs that have received multiple transfusions is delayed destruction of the red blood cells, caused by antibodies to some of the minor blood group antigens."

It can develop from loss, destruction, or lack of production of red blood cells. Anemia is classified as regenerative or nonregenerative. In a regenerative anemia, the bone marrow responds appropriately to the decreased number of red blood cells by increasing production of new blood cells. In a nonregenerative anemia, the bone marrow responds inadequately to the increased need for red blood cells. Anemias due to bleeding or the destruction of existing red blood cells are usually regenerative. Anemias that are caused by a decrease in the hormone that stimulates red blood cell production or by an abnormality in the bone marrow are nonregenerative."

After rapid blood loss, the animal usually has an increased heart rate, pale gums, and low blood pressure. The cause of the blood loss may be obvious, for example, a major injury. If no evidence of external bleeding is found, your veterinarian will look for a source of internal or hidden blood loss, for example, a ruptured tumor on the spleen, a stomach ulcer, a bleeding disorder, or parasites. If red blood cells are being destroyed, the animal may appear jaundiced (a yellowish color of the whites of the eyes, skin, or gums). Animals with long-term anemia have had time to adjust, and their signs are usually slower to develop. These include loss of energy, weakness, and loss of appetite. Affected animals will have similar physical examination findings, such as pale gums, an increased heart rate, and possibly enlargement of the spleen or a heart murmur."

The antibodies develop in the mother during unmatched blood transfusions. Newborns with neonatal isoerythrolysis are normal at birth but develop severe hemolytic anemia within 2 to 3 days and become weak and jaundiced. A veterinarian can perform tests to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment consists of stopping all nursing from the mother, providing nutrition through a milk replacer, and, in some cases, giving blood transfusions. If a pregnant bitch is known to have received a blood transfusion in the past, her blood should be tested against the newborn puppies’ blood before that litter is allowed to nurse."

Pyruvate kinase (enzyme) deficiencies are seen in Basenjis, Beagles, West Highland White Terriers, Cairn Terriers, and other breeds. Phosphofructokinase (enzyme) deficiency occurs in English Springer Spaniels. Deficiencies in these enzymes lead to shortened red blood cell life span and a regenerative anemia. In dogs with phosphofructokinase deficiency, the sudden destruction of red blood cells is caused by a high blood pH created after excessive excitement or exercise. If such situations are minimized, these dogs may have a normal life expectancy. There is no treatment for pyruvate kinase deficiency, and affected dogs will have a shortened life span due to abnormalities of the bone marrow."

Anemia develops gradually and may initially be regenerative, but ultimately becomes nonregenerative. Starvation causes anemia by a combination of vitamin and mineral deficiencies as well as a negative energy and protein balance. The deficiencies most likely to cause anemia are iron, copper, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, riboflavin, niacin, and vitamin E."

The anemia can occur after a longterm inflammation or infection, a tumor, liver disease, or hormonal disorders such as hyper- or hypoadrenocorticism (disorders of the adrenal gland) or hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid gland). Proteins called cytokines, which are produced by inflammatory cells, lead to decreases in iron availability, red blood cell survival, and the bone marrow’s ability to regenerate, resulting in anemia. Treatment of the underlying disease leads to correction of the anemia. There are also medications available that stimulate the production of red blood cells, but they may cause side effects."

Most cases have no known cause, but some are caused by infections, drug therapy, toxins, or total body irradiation. The immune system may also be involved in the development of this disease. The disease is diagnosed by taking a bone marrow sample. To treat the condition, the underlying cause must be determined and eliminated. Supportive care, such as antibiotics and transfusions, and medications that suppress the immune system may also be needed. Drugs that stimulate the bone marrow can be used until the marrow recovers. If the disease has no known cause or if marrow recovery is unlikely (for example, phenylbutazone poisoning in dogs), bone marrow transplantation is helpful if a suitable donor is available. However, bone marrow transplantation may not be available in all areas."

Primary leukemias are uncommon, but they have been reported in dogs. Leukemias can develop in bone marrow or the lymphatic system and are classified as acute (sudden and often severe) or chronic (long-lasting, with signs that are generally less severe). Acute leukemias, in which the marrow is filled with immature blood cells, generally respond poorly to chemotherapy. In animals that do respond, remission times are usually short. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia in dogs, the response rate to chemotherapy for the most common type of acute leukemia is about 30%, with about half the dogs surviving for at least 4 months. Other types of acute leukemia are less common and even less responsive to treatment. Chronic leukemias, in which there is greatly increased production of one blood cell line, are less likely to cause anemia and are more responsive to treatment."

This organism is transmitted by ticks, but its mode of transmission is unusual. The tick picks up the organism from an infected host while biting the animal. An uninfected dog gets the disease by eating the tick (or animals that ate a tick), not from being bitten by the tick. In most of the world, the protozoan Hepatozoon canis is transmitted by the brown dog tick, causing Old World hepatozoonosis. In North America, the signs in infected dogs are different and more severe than in other parts of the world, and the disease is caused by a different Hepatozoon species, which is now called Hepatozoon americanum. This species is transmitted by the Gulf Coast tick instead of by the brown dog tick. Because of these differences, the disease in North America is referred to as American canine hepatozoonosis (see below)."

Kissing bugs transmit the disease between susceptible species of animals, and infections have been identified in more than 100 different species of mammals. Birds are not affected. The disease occurs most often in people and dogs. Wildlife, including opossums, armadillos, rodents, and wild carnivores, serve as a source of infection. Dogs may become infected and introduce the trypanosome into houses where the bugs are present. People and dogs become infected by contamination of wounds or by eating food contaminated with insect droppings that contain trypanosomes. Affected dogs may die suddenly or have short- or long-term inflammation of the heart muscle. Other signs include swollen lymph nodes, decreased appetite and energy, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, and an enlarged liver or spleen. Patients with longterm infections can develop life-threatening heart failure. The disease is diagnosed by identifying the parasite or antibodies in an animal's blood. A medication that kills the parasite is used to treat the disease. Because vaccines are not available, Chagas' disease is controlled by reducing the number of insects that spread the disease."

    "text": "Malignant lymphoma is a common cancer in dogs. It is a progressive, deadly disease caused by the harmful growth of lymphocytes. Lymphoma most commonly arises from lymphoid tissues in the bone marrow, thymus, lymph nodes, or spleen. Other common sites include the skin, eye, central nervous system, and bone. Although it is common, the causes and origin of the disease are not well understood. Possible causes or contributing factors include viral infection, environmental contamination with herbicides, magnetic field exposure, genetic abnormalities, and dysfunction of the immune system."

Most types of lymphoma are high-grade and involve T cells or B cells. In dogs, lymphoma has been classically characterized by body locations in which they occur: 1) multicentric, which originates in multiple places; 2) alimentary, which occurs in the digestive system, 3) mediastinal, which occurs within the chest; and 4) extranodal, which may involve the kidneys, central nervous system, or skin."

An early sign of multicentric lymphoma is the rapid and nonpainful enlargement of lymph nodes, which may become 3 to 10 times their normal size. In addition to this, cancerous lymphocytes may move into internal organs including the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and other sites. Late in the course of disease, when there are multiple, large tumors, dogs may show general signs of illness, including lack of energy, weakness, fever, loss of appetite, and dehydration."

Individual treatment plans vary with respect to the drugs used, dosage, and frequency and duration of treatment. With chemotherapy, the expected survival time for dogs with B-cell lymphoma is about 12 months. For dogs with T-cell lymphoma, expected survival times are shorter (6 months). Dogs that do not respond to the usual drugs may improve when other treatment plans are used. These alternate plans may include other drugs or radiation. In recent years, treatment has included both initial and longterm medications. Now, similar or improved responses are seen with shorter term therapies, and chemotherapy is often stopped once remission is reached. Bone marrow transplants may even be an option for some dogs."

Alimentary lymphoma, if concentrated in one area, can be treated effectively with surgery to remove the tumor, together with combination chemotherapy. However, if lymphoma is spread throughout the intestinal tract, the response to treatment is not as good and survival times are shorter (often less than 3 months). The use of combination chemotherapy with or without radiation can give dogs with mediastinal lymphoma considerable improvement in survival times and quality-of-life scores. Dogs with an abnormally high level of calcium in the blood, a condition often associated with mediastinal lymphoma, are also less likely to live for long. Lymphoma involving other extranodal sites, such as the skin, can be managed with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy as appropriate; however, the disease often stops responding to treatment. Dogs with low-grade lymphoma tend to do well and with chemotherapy can survive longer than two years."

    "text": "When bleeding occurs in an organ or body part, a process is set in motion to stop the bleeding. This is called hemostasis. In order to work, hemostasis requires an adequate number of platelets, the right amount of blood clotting proteins (often referred to as factors), and blood vessels that constrict properly. When an injury occurs, the wall of the blood vessel breaks. A normally responsive blood vessel will narrow so that blood flows more slowly, allowing the clotting process to begin. Platelets also rush to the broken wall where certain proteins change the platelets’ shape from round to spiny so that they can stick to blood cells, the broken vessel wall, and to each other. Other proteins form long strands called fibrin. These fibrin strands form a net that traps and helps hold together the platelets and blood cells, creating a clot that plugs the break in the vessel wall. After the clot has formed and stabilized, other proteins stop the clotting process and eventually dissolve the clot."

Animals may be stillborn or die shortly after birth. Lack of clotting proteins or vitamin K (which is also part of the clotting process) in a newborn animal may make a clotting defect worse. If the amount of any particular clotting protein is 5 to 10% of normal, the newborn may survive, but will usually show signs of illness before 6 months of age. It is during this time, when numerous routine procedures (for example, vaccination, dewclaw removal, and neutering or spaying) are usually done, that a bleeding tendency may be noticed by your veterinarian. Most of the clotting protein disorders present at birth in domestic animals are defects of a single protein."

Animals with 5 to 10% of normal activity typically do not bleed spontaneously but bleed more than usual after an injury or surgery. Small dogs may be less likely to show signs of illness. Carrier animals have higher levels of Factor VIII (40 to 60% of normal), and the results of their clotting tests are usually normal. The diagnosis is harder to confirm in animals less than 6 months old because their livers may not yet have produced enough of the clotting proteins.

It usually develops after a triggering event, such as severe infection, heat stroke, burn, tumor, or severe injury. In many cases, the signs are uncontrolled bleeding and the inability to form a normal clot. Death is caused by extensive blood clots or collapse of circulation, leading to the failure of one or several organs. Your veterinarian will determine and attempt to correct the underlying problem causing this condition. Intravenous fluids are extremely important for maintaining normal circulation. The underlying cause must be treated promptly, and anti-clotting drugs may be necessary. DIC is a very serious disorder and is often fatal. Chances of survival are increased with an earlier diagnosis, but early diagnosis can be difficult and requires specialized testing."

Such injuries lead to tendinitis, which is inflammation of the tendons. Because tendons and ligaments are relatively poorly supplied with blood, they heal slowly and sometimes imperfectly. Injuries to ligaments and tendons require patience and careful longterm rehabilitation. Healed tendons are not as strong and are prone to future injuries."

Growing animals that are fed too much protein or have improper balance of calcium and phosphorus can also develop nutritional disorders affecting bones. Getting either too much or too little of certain vitamins, particularly vitamins A and D, can influence bone growth and development."

A veterinarian performs a lameness examination in order to identify changes to musculoskeletal tissues. The veterinarian observes the animal resting, getting up, and walking. He or she watches to see if the injury affects one limb or several limbs and how the degree of reaction varies with each type of activity. If a forelimb is lame, the animal generally raises its head when putting weight on that limb. The stride is also shortened on the affected side. If a hindlimb is lame, the animal generally drops its head when putting weight on that limb. The veterinarian will feel the animal’s bones, joints, and soft tissue for abnormalities such as swelling, pain, instability, a grating or crackling sound, reduced range of motion, and wasting away of muscle. More than one examination, sometimes with exercise in between, may be necessary. For irritable animals or certain tests, sedation may be required."

Within 1 week the animals become more active and show an improved attitude. Jumping or climbing must be prevented because the skeleton is still susceptible to fractures. Restrictions can usually be relaxed after 3 weeks, but confinement with limited movement is recommended until the skeleton returns to normal. Response to treatment can be monitored using x-rays."

Nasal cavities may be damaged and teeth loosened. Some dogs lose the ability to close the mouth properly and develop slow-healing sores in the gums. Often the jaw-bones become coarsely thickened, while bones in the skull grow thin and appear “moth-eaten” in x-rays.

The lowered calcium level in turn triggers an increase in parathyroid hormone levels. In addition, the kidneys are necessary to produce the active form of vitamin D (calcitriol). Too little calcitriol leads to further increases in parathyroid hormone levels."

Physical examination and the presence of the characteristic signs suggest the diagnosis, and x-rays can confirm it.

The tendon can be partially or completely ruptured or torn away from the bone. Signs include a severe lameness that keeps the animal from putting weight on the leg, excessive bending of the tarsus (ankle), and a stance in which the heel touches the ground. Swelling, pain, and torn or thickened tendon ends may also be seen. X-rays are useful for diagnosis and may reveal fragments torn from the bone."

Some cysts are visible to the naked eye, but others are too small to see. Their size depends on the species of the host and the species of Sarcocystis. A dog can develop sarcocystosis after eating undercooked beef or pork containing sporocysts or after eating food infected with sporocysts from another animal’s feces.

The spinal cord of dogs is divided into regions that correspond to the vertebral bodies (the bones that make up the spine) in the following order from neck to tail: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and caudal segments. Specialized tissues called the meninges cover the brain and spinal cord, and cerebrospinal fluid surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord."

    "text": "Several different types of radiographic tests can be used to detect disorders of the nervous system. Plain x-rays of the skull and spine can detect fractures, infections, or bone cancer. However, in most infections or cancers of the brain and spinal cord, plain x‑rays appear normal. In a procedure known as myelography, a special dye that is visible on x‑rays is injected into the cerebrospinal canal. This dye can highlight specific types of spinal problems, such as herniated (“slipped”) discs and spinal cord tumors. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can also help evaluate changes in bone structure, internal bleeding, abscesses, inflammation, and certain nervous system cancers."

    "text": "Other tests may be used in some cases. An electroencephalogram records electrical activity in the brain. Results are abnormal in meningitis or encephalitis, head injuries, brain tumors, and a condition called hydrocephalus (water on the brain). An electroencephalogram can sometimes help determine the cause and severity of a seizure. An electromyogram records electrical activity in muscles to evaluate nerve and muscle function. In this test, a nerve is stimulated electrically, and the speed of conduction along the neurons is calculated. This technique can detect nerve injury and myasthenia gravis. A brain stem auditory evoked response (BAER) records electrical activity in the pathway from the sound receptors in the ear to the brain stem and cerebrum. In cases of deafness caused by nerve damage, the BAER generates no response. Brain stem disorders may also change the BAER. Spinal cord evoked potentials are a test of spinal cord function. They are done by stimulating a peripheral nerve and then measuring electrical activity in the spinal cord."

Drugs used to treat epileptic seizures are known as anticonvulsants. Anti-inflammatory medications, including corticosteroids, are used to reduce swelling and inflammation in many types of injuries. These medications may be given intravenously in some cases (such as spinal cord injury) and by mouth in others. Other medications may be needed to relieve muscle spasms caused by neurologic disorders or to treat infections of the nervous system."

The skin must be kept clean and free of urine and feces. In animals that cannot urinate properly, the urinary bladder may need to be expressed (manually emptied), or a urinary catheter may be necessary. Urinalyses must be done every 2 to 4 weeks to monitor for bladder infection. Quadriplegic animals need to be hand fed and given plenty of water. Manually flexing and massaging the dog’s joints and muscles can delay muscle wasting in paralyzed limbs."

In most cases, the cause is unknown, and the disorder is a component of more widespread degeneration of peripheral nerves known as canine chronic axonal degeneration (see below). It can also be caused by an injury or tumor affecting the neck or by thyroid disorders. The condition occurs when nerve degeneration leads to paralysis of one or more cartilages in the larynx (\"voice box\"). The paralyzed cartilage(s) partially block the airway, causing a voice change, noisy breathing, or a dry cough. In severe cases, the dog may have difficulty breathing, be unwilling or unable to exercise, and the tongue and gums may turn bluish. Some dogs have more general signs of a neurologic disorder, such as weakness and reduced sense of position. Veterinarians diagnose the condition by examining the dog's larynx while the dog is under light anesthesia. Although surgery cannot completely resolve the signs, it can usually relieve the breathing difficulties."

The sciatic nerve, which runs from the lower back to the hind legs, may be injured by hip fractures or during surgery to correct a broken leg. Irritants injected in or near the nerve can also cause nerve damage. The leg may be partially paralyzed, or the animal may not be able to flex the knee. The paw and digits cannot flex or extend. There may be loss of sensation below the knee. Injury to the branches of the sciatic nerve in the lower leg, such as the tibial nerve or the peroneal nerve, can result in an inability to extend the paw or flex the digits and reduced sensation over the surface of the foot."

Nerve tissue regenerates or heals very slowly. Recovery is unlikely if the severed ends of the nerve are widely separated or if scar tissue interferes with healing. Anti-inflammatory drugs have been used to treat traumatic nerve injuries, although there is little evidence of any benefit. Surgery should be performed promptly in cases in which the nerve has been cut. In cases of injury from a fall or a blunt object, surgical exploration and removal of scar tissue may help. Longterm care consists of physical therapy to minimize muscle wasting and to keep the joints moving. Bandages or splints may be necessary to help protect a damaged limb."

Signs include sudden, painful hind limb weakness or paralysis with a loss of several reflexes. Treament includes pain medications, supportive care, and management of the underlying disease that caused the blockage. Medications that prevent clotting may also be used. Improvement can be seen within 2–3 weeks, but it can take up to 6 months for an animal to recover completely. Unfortunately, many animals do not survive the first episode, and those that do have an uncertain longterm outcome because of serious underlying conditions and increased risk for future blood clots."

DAWS affects middle-aged (approximately 7 years old), large-breed dogs, especially Doberman Pinschers. In this condition, one or more discs between the neck vertebrae extend into the spinal canal and squeeze the spinal cord. Bony-associated compression affects young (usually 4 years or younger), giant-breed dogs, such as Great Danes, Mastiffs, and Rottweilers. In this condition, abnormal bone growth occurs in the vertebrae of the neck and squeezes the spinal cord. For both forms of the disease, signs occur slowly or suddenly and include incoordination and an abnormal stride when walking on all four limbs. Weakness or paralysis in all legs as well as neck pain may also be present. X-rays can help rule out other conditions, but diagnosis requires magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT). Dogs with mild signs may improve with rest and medication, but surgery is often necessary. Most dogs (~80%) do well with surgery."

It is a common cause of spinal cord disorders in dogs, especially of small breeds, particularly the Dachshund, Beagle, Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, and Pekingese. In these breeds, spinal discs can begin degenerating in the first few months of life. A herniated or “slipped” disc causing severe signs can occur suddenly, as early as 1 to 2 years of age. In contrast, disc degeneration in large breeds of dogs typically occurs after the age of 5 years, and signs slowly continue to worsen. Herniated discs are most common in the neck and the middle of the back. A herniated disc in the neck leads to neck pain, stiffness, and muscle spasms. There may be muscle weakness or other signs, ranging from mild partial paralysis in the legs to total paralysis of all legs. A herniated disc in the middle of the back leads to back pain, and possibly curvature in the spine and a reluctance to move. Neurologic signs range from a loss of motor control in the hind legs to paralysis and incontinence. In paralyzed animals, it is important to determine whether pain sensation is present by pinching the toe or tail and watching whether the dog makes a behavioral response, such as a bark or turn of the head."

A veterinarian will need a history of the dog’s possible chemical exposure to make the correct diagnosis. The outlook for recovery is poor for animals with severe signs."

Dogs are fairly resistant to tetanus, but cases do sometimes occur. Signs usually develop within 5 to 10 days of infection and include muscle stiffness and rigid leg extension, inability to swallow, protruding eyelids, and locking of the jaw and facial muscles. In severe cases, the animal may be unable to stand as a result of muscle spasms. Treatment consists of wound care, antibiotics to kill any remaining organisms, and tetanus antitoxin. In mild cases, a dog may recover completely with early treatment. In severe cases, death may occur due to respiratory paralysis."

Cases have been reported from both Europe and the United States, where canine dysautonomia has been seen primarily in the Midwest. Signs often include a loss of the pupillary light reflexes, with otherwise normal vision. The eyelid may droop or protrude abnormally, and the position of the eyeball may be abnormal. The dog may experience painful or difficult urination and lose anal sphincter control. Secondary signs such as pneumonia and lethargic behavior may develop. Weight loss may be dramatic. There is no treatment and the condition is ultimately fatal."

The closer a nerve injury is to the muscle, the better the outlook for recovery, so it is important to determine the exact location of the injury. The ability or inability of the animal to flex the joint and bear weight on the leg, and the presence or absence of pain sensation and reflexes at various places in the leg, depend on the site of the nerve damage. Within a few days, muscles wither and lose mass because of the lost nerve connection. Electrical stimulation of the nerve can be used to determine the location of the nerve injury and whether the nerve is partially intact. Nerves regenerate slowly (about 1 inch per month), and full functional recovery depends on the condition of the nerve sheath and on the distance between the injury and the muscle where the nerve ends. Some nerve injuries can resolve after several weeks or months; however, when total nerve rupture occurs, surgical reattachment is required for regeneration."

Fear of the vehicle may be a contributing factor in dogs and cats, and signs may occur even in a vehicle that is not moving. This occurs if a dog has become preconditioned to illness associated with travel in a vehicle."

It causes sudden, progressive inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. Once clinical signs appear, it is fatal. Rabies is found throughout the world, although a few countries are declared rabies-free due to successful elimination programs. Islands that have a strict quarantine program in effect are often rabies-free. In North America and Europe, rabies has been mostly eliminated in domestic dogs, although it affects wildlife, especially foxes, raccoons, skunks, and bats."

The animal becomes irritable and may viciously and aggressively use its teeth and claws with the slightest provocation. The posture is alert and anxious, with pupils dilated. Noise can invite attack. Such animals lose fear and caution of other animals. Young pups seek out human companionship and are overly playful, but will bite even when petted and become vicious within a few hours. As the disease progresses, seizures and lack of muscle coordination are common. Death is caused by progressive paralysis."

Dogs with trouble breathing may require additional therapy, such as oxygen and breathing assistance under anesthesia. Other organs affected by the toxin may also require additional treatments. About 5% of animals are likely to die, despite treatment, especially if the stages of paralysis are advanced, if the ability to breathe is significantly impaired, or if the animal is very young or old.

These so-called intestinal flora are actually beneficial, in some cases aiding in digestion and in others helping to prevent infection. However, sometimes infections occur when these organisms, normally found in small numbers, suddenly multiply. This can occur after a period of stress, under unhygienic conditions, or in an animal whose immune system is weakened."

    "text": "Parasites are a frequent cause of digestive tract disorders in animals. Many species of parasites can infect the digestive tract and cause disease. The life cycles of some parasites are direct, which means that there is only one host. Eggs and larvae are passed in the feces, develop into an infective stage, and are eaten by your pet. No other animals or organisms are needed to complete the life cycle. Other parasites have complex life cycles that involve an intermediate host, such as an insect. In this situation, infection is acquired when the intermediate host—or parasite shed by that host—is consumed by your pet. The extent to which a parasite affects an animal depends on the parasite itself, as well as the animal’s own resistance, age, nutrition, and overall health."

Their causes include overeating, eating poor-quality or indigestible food, chemicals, obstruction caused by swallowing foreign objects, or injury to the digestive system. Digestive system disease can also be caused by enzyme deficiencies, damage to the digestive tract (such as from gastric ulcers or inflammation), or birth defects. Digestive system signs such as vomiting and diarrhea may also occur because of other diseases in the body, such as kidney, liver, or adrenal gland disease. The causes are uncertain in several diseases, including twisting of the stomach (gastric torsion) in dogs. In noninfectious diseases of the digestive tract, usually only a single animal is affected at one time; exceptions are diseases associated with excessive food intake or poisons, in which multiple animals living together can be affected."

Some congenital abnormalities of the esophagus seen in dogs include megaesophagus, vascular ring anomalies, and crichopharyngeal achalasia ( see Table: Congenital Esophageal Disorders of Dogs). Signs of defects in the esophagus generally include regurgitation and problems with swallowing. These signs are especially noticeable when your dog starts to eat solid food. Regurgitated food can enter the lungs and cause frequent and severe pneumonia. These conditions are typically diagnosed with x-rays, usually done after the dog swallows a liquid dye that shows up on the x-ray. Other specialized tests may also be necessary. Surgical correction of some esophageal abnormalities (for example, vascular ring anomalies, in which abnormal blood vessels surround and restrict the esophagus) is effective if done early. If not, the esophagus can become permanently damaged by the stretching caused by trapped food. Feeding small amounts of soft foods in an elevated bowl can help affected dogs.

Signs of a hernia vary from none to severe and depend on the amount of herniated tissue and its effect on the organ involved. Hiatal hernias involve extension of part of the stomach through the diaphragm. These hernias may be “sliding” and result in signs (such as loss of appetite, drooling, or vomiting) that come and go. Hernias are diagnosed using x-rays; contrast studies (x-rays that include special dyes to outline organs) are often needed. Endoscopy may be used to diagnose sliding hiatal hernias.

    "text": "Besides hiatal hernia (see above), another common abnormality involving the stomach is pyloric stenosis. It is likely that pyloric stenosis is inherited. This condition results from muscular thickening of the pyloric sphincter (the “exit” of the stomach). The thickening of this opening slows or blocks the flow of digested food from the stomach to the small intestine. Affected breeds include smaller breeds and those with flattened, shortened heads, especially Boxers, Bull Dogs, and Boston Terriers. Because the flow of food out of the stomach is restricted, dogs with this condition will often vomit food for several hours after a meal. Although dietary modification and medication may help, surgery is usually recommended."

    "text": "Maldigestion is a condition in which certain foods are not properly digested. Malabsorption occurs when nutrients are not properly absorbed into the bloodstream. These conditions often cause persistent digestive system problems, including vomiting, weight loss, diarrhea, or a combination of these signs. There are many potential causes of maldigestion and malabsorption. Some are inherited; some are acquired. Most are associated with inflammation of the intestines (called inflammatory bowel disease). Inherited conditions may occur more often in specific breeds. For example, Irish Setters have a family tendency for sensitivity to wheat protein (gluten), with signs beginning as early as 6 months of age. The wheat sensitivity is both confirmed and treated through the use of gluten-free diets. Malabsorption and maldigestion are often treated with a combination of dietary changes and medication; the exact treatment will depend on the condition being treated. In certain conditions in which protein loss is severe (for example, in Soft-coated Wheaten Terriers with protein-losing enteropathy and nephropathy), neither dietary changes nor treatment have been proven effective, and the outlook is poor."

    "text": "The most common liver defect present at birth is portosystemic shunt. In a healthy animal, blood coming from the intestines is processed by the liver, which removes toxins from the bloodstream before they reach the brain or other organs. In an animal with a portosystemic shunt, however, blood bypasses the liver through one or more “shortcuts” (shunts) and enters directly into the general circulatory system. Breeds with an increased risk of this defect include Yorkshire Terriers, Miniature Schnauzers, Cairn Terriers, Maltese, Havanese, Scottish Terriers, Pugs, Irish Wolfhounds, Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, German Shepherds, Cattle Dogs, Old English Sheepdogs, and Poodles. Signs of a portosystemic shunt include nervous system disturbances and a failure to grow and thrive. In the late stages, protein-containing fluid may accumulate in the abdomen, a condition called ascites. Your veterinarian may also notice enlargement of the kidneys and kidney stones. A definite diagnosis is made by using an opaque dye to highlight the blood vessels, followed by x-rays. This procedure can identify the location of the shunt and determine whether it is single or multiple. It also allows the veterinarian to assess whether surgical correction is possible. Animals with multiple shunts tend to do poorly."

It generally causes no signs, but when seen, signs are similar to those in dogs with a portosystemic shunt. Dogs that do exhibit signs may be treated with medication.

The condition is found in Bedlington Terriers and leads to chronic liver failure in older dogs. Carrier dogs, which have no signs of the disease but can pass it on to their puppies, are also seen. Elevated copper levels have also been observed as part of the inherited liver disease of West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, Dalmatians, and Doberman Pinschers. There are apparent variations even within breeds; for example, liver copper levels are worse in Bedlington and West Highland White Terriers of North American descent than in the same breeds from Europe or other regions. Treatment involves the use of drugs that bind copper (chelators) or prevent its absorption, low-copper diets, and other supportive measures directed at helping animals with liver disease. If your dog has copper-associated hepatopathy, follow your veterinarian’s directions for medication, diet, and other treatment carefully and fully."

Dogs that have a regular diet of hard kibble develop fewer problems due to the mechanical cleaning effect on the teeth as the food is chewed. Back teeth are affected more often than front teeth. The upper teeth are affected more severely than the lower teeth, and the cheek surfaces of the teeth have more disease than the surfaces near the tongue.

Normally, shedding begins around 14 weeks of age with the loss of the upper central incisors. For the next 3 months, the baby teeth are replaced with permanent teeth. Additional permanent teeth that complete the dog’s tooth pattern also erupt during this stage. If the baby teeth are not lost at the time the corresponding permanent teeth are coming in, abnormal tooth position and bite may result. If retained baby teeth are removed by a veterinarian as soon as they are noticed; complications can usually be prevented from occurring later on."

    "text": "Another developmental problem noted in Stage 2 is abnormal positioning (tilting) of lower or upper canine teeth. Depending on the specific situation and age of the dog, orthodontic treatment (that is, “braces” for your pet) can be used to align teeth in their correct positions. Tilting of the upper canines typically is seen in Shetland Sheepdogs, although it has been reported in many other small breeds. Overbite is sometimes noticed during this stage and can be treated with a special plate fitted in the mouth. In more severe cases, tooth shortening or extractions might be necessary."

The canine distemper virus is especially damaging because it both attacks the enamel-producing cells of the teeth and causes a fever. This results in tooth enamel that is thinner than normal. Other fever-causing diseases may result in enamel that does not develop properly and is weaker than normal. Severe malnutrition in young dogs may result in enamel defects. Enamel defects in isolated teeth are most likely the result of trauma or infection. Often, the infections in fractured baby teeth affect the enamel of the permanent teeth that come in behind them. Enamel defects may also be inherited, especially in Siberian Huskies."

Fractured teeth should be inspected by a veterinarian to determine whether there has been damage to the tooth pulp. If fractures extend into the pulp, root canal (endodontic) treatment or tooth extraction will be needed. Restorative techniques such crowns can repair defects in tooth structure if the damage is limited to the hard tissues or the pulp has already been treated with root canal treatment. Wounds to the gums or other soft tissues should be treated by the veterinarian as well."

Some of its additional functions include communication and social interaction, grooming, protection, and heat regulation (particularly in dogs). Picking up food, chewing, and swallowing require a complex interaction of the muscles of the jaw, the teeth, the tongue, and the upper throat. When any of these functions becomes compromised through disease or trauma, malnutrition and dehydration may result. A complete oral examination should be a part of your animal’s physical examination, because oral diseases are most effectively treated with early diagnosis. Otherwise, many will remain hidden in the mouth and progress to an advanced stage."

The characteristic feature is the contact ulcer or sore that develops where the lip contacts the tooth surface, most commonly on the inner surface of the upper lip next to the upper canine and carnassial teeth (also called the 4th premolar). These abnormalities have also been termed “kissing ulcers” because they are found where the lips “kiss” the teeth.

Discomfort caused by the ulcers can make it difficult to brush your pet’s teeth and give oral medications. If discomfort is severe and you are unable to brush the teeth, extraction of the adjacent teeth may be necessary to remove the contact surfaces on which plaque accumulates. Although extraction may aid in control of the sores, it may not completely cure the problem, as plaque grows on all surfaces in the mouth and animals can continue to develop sores."

Historically, this condition is uncommon in dogs and cats, but is very common in humans who have damaged salivary glands following radiation treatment for tumors of the head and neck. As radiation treatment is used more commonly in veterinary medicine, this condition may become more frequent in pets. Decreased salivary secretion may also result from use of certain drugs, extreme dehydration, fever, anesthesia, immune system dysfunction, or disease of the salivary gland. It is also seen in some dogs with \"dry eye\" (keratoconjunctivitis). Finding and treating the underlying cause is important in controlling xerostomia. Specially formulated mouthwashes can often help relieve the discomfort that results from this condition. Fluids may be administered to correct dehydration, if present.

A tendency to occur in families has been reported in German Shepherds, Newfoundlands, Great Danes, Irish Setters, Chinese Shar-Peis, Labrador Retrievers, and cats. Abnormal blood vessels (called vascular ring anomalies) can also trap the esophagus and cause megaesophagus. Some causes of megaesophagus include myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis, hypoadrenocorticism, poisoning, dysautonomia, glycogen storage disease, nervous system disorders including cancer, and possibly hypothyroidism.

It may develop after trauma (for example, ingestion of a foreign object or caustic substance), anesthesia, use of certain drugs, inflammation of the esophagus, gastroesophageal reflux (gastric acid flowing back into the esophagus), or tumor invasion. Signs include regurgitation, excessive drooling, difficulty swallowing, and pain. Examining the esophagus using fluoroscopy is the preferred method for diagnosis; endoscopy can also be used. These tests enable your veterinarian to actually see the number, location, and types of strictures."

When seen, signs include regurgitation, drooling, repeated swallowing, pain, depression, lack of appetite, trouble eating, or extension of the head or neck. If signs are present, drugs may be prescribed. For example, if the problem is caused by acid reflux (a cause of heartburn in people), drugs that reduce stomach acid can provide relief for your pet. Other prescription medications increase muscle tone in the lower esophagus, reducing the amount of acid that escapes upward. Pain medications may also be appropriate. Your veterinarian may recommend feeding your pet a diet of soft food, low in fat and fiber, in small, frequent meals. If inflammation is severe, a feeding tube placed through the body wall into the stomach, bypassing the esophagus, may need to be inserted to allow the esophagus to rest. Antibiotics are sometimes prescribed to prevent or treat bacterial infection."

Bones are the most common, but needles, fishhooks, wood, rawhide pieces, and other objects may also become lodged in the esophagus. Sudden and excessive drooling, gagging, regurgitation, and repeated attempts to swallow are signs of an esophageal foreign object. A partial obstruction may allow fluids but not food to pass. If an obstruction is not treated, loss of appetite, weight loss, and lethargy may occur. In addition, the foreign object can perforate the esophagus, which may require surgery. An esophageal stricture, which is a narrowing of the width of the esophagus, is the most common complication of an esophageal foreign object. Aspiration pneumonia may also be seen if regurgitated material is inhaled into the lungs."

In many cases, your veterinarian will be able to remove the foreign object through the dog’s mouth, using a flexible endoscope and forceps (large tweezers) or other instrument. If the object cannot be removed by mouth, sometimes it can be pushed into the stomach where it can be digested, passed in the feces, or removed via surgery. Surgery is necessary if the esophagus has been perforated or the foreign object cannot be removed using endoscopy; in these cases, the overall recovery rate has been reported to be greater than 90%."

Dehydrated animals and animals with kidney or heart disease may require intravenous fluids during this time. If the vomiting has stopped after 24 hours, the dog may be offered small amounts (for example, a teaspoonful) of easily digested food. If no further vomiting occurs, feeding can usually be slowly resumed. Follow the treatment directions provided by your veterinarian carefully.

It attacks rapidly dividing cells throughout the body, especially those in the bone marrow, blood cell-producing tissue, and the lining of the small intestine. Production of the virus in the intestinal lining causes severe damage and bloody diarrhea. Normal intestinal bacteria may enter the damaged tissue and the bloodstream, worsening the disease. Affected dogs can also have decreased numbers of white blood cells, which normally protect the body from infections. This allows for further damage by the virus and secondary bacterial infections. In young puppies infection may also rarely involve the heart, leading to signs of heart failure without digestive signs, such as diarrhea."

Once feeding is resumed, dissolvable fiber may be added to the diet. Over time, the fiber dose can be often be reduced or eliminated and a standard dog food substituted without causing a return of the diarrhea. When feeding is first resumed, you may be advised to provide food with a type of protein that your dog has not previously eaten, such as duck, lamb, kangaroo, or venison. This change is to reduce the chance that your pet will have an allergic reaction to the food proteins. There are several other types of diets that veterinarians can recommend for longterm colitis."

To help the inflammation resolve more rapidly, your veterinarian may add anti-inflammatory medication to the change in diet. An alternative or additional anti-inflammatory medications can be used in dogs that do not respond initially. Some animals require additional short-term use of antidiarrheal medications until inflammation is brought under control, but do not use these medications unless recommended by a veterinarian. Anti-parasitic medications may also be recommended."

Obstruction is most common and is due to the dog’s inability to pass poorly digestible, often firm matter (such as hair or bones) that has become mixed with fecal material. A lack of water intake or the reluctance to defecate on a regular basis due to environmental stress or pain that occurs while defecating contributes to the formation of hard, dry feces. In other cases, tumors may block the passage of feces. Constriction may be caused by compression of the colon or rectum by a narrowed pelvic bone (for example, if a broken pelvis heals incorrectly), an enlarged prostate gland or lymph nodes, or cancer. Constipation can also result because of neuromuscular problems, which can be caused by hypothyroidism, dysautonomia, spinal cord disease, pelvic nerve dysfunction, or electrolyte abnormalities. Some drugs may cause constipation as a side effect."

Some animals are quite ill and also have lethargy, depression, loss of appetite, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. Your veterinarian can confirm the presence of retained fecal matter by feeling the abdomen and performing a rectal examination. Abdominal x-rays may help establish the cause of fecal retention and indicate whether the feces contain foreign matter, such as bones. Be sure to tell your veterinarian about any tendency your pet has to eat bones, garbage, or other hard matter. Other tests may be needed in cases of longterm constipation or obstipation."

Mild constipation can often be treated by switching to a high-fiber diet, keeping the dog from eating bones or other objects, providing ready access to water, and using appropriate laxatives (usually for a short time only). If laxatives are prescribed, they will be ones suitable for your pet. Laxatives formulated for humans can be very dangerous for animals, especially cats. In more severe cases of constipation, a veterinarian can remove retained feces using enemas or manual extraction while your pet is under general anesthesia. Complete removal of all feces may require 2 or 3 attempts over several days. To prevent recurrence, veterinarians often recommend a high-fiber diet, easy access to water, and frequent opportunities to defecate. Animals with longterm constipation that does not respond to diet changes and medications may require surgery."

This may be done by passing a tube through the mouth into the stomach. Once the tube enters the stomach, gas readily escapes. Excess fluid and food can then be removed via gravity and suction. After the stomach has been decompressed, the veterinarian may rinse it with warm water or saline to remove any remaining debris. If a tube cannot be passed into the stomach, excess gas may be relieved by inserting a large, hollow needle and catheter directly into the stomach through the skin."

It can be caused by eating something that irritates or injures the stomach lining, infections, parasites, body-wide illnesses, drugs, or poisons. In cases of acute gastritis, the vomiting is sudden, and the vomited material may contain evidence of whatever the pet ate (grass, for example). Bile, froth, fresh blood, or digested blood that looks like coffee grounds may also be present. Abdominal pain may be signaled by a dog that displays a “praying” position, with the hindquarters raised and chest and forelegs held close to the floor; this position appears to provide some relief. Excessive thirst is often followed by immediate vomiting in dogs with sudden gastritis. Diarrhea may also be noted. Short-term or occasional vomiting is generally not associated with other abnormalities; however, longterm vomiting may be associated with weakness, lethargy, weight loss, dehydration, and electrolyte (salt) imbalance and acid-base disorders. Lymphocytic-plasmacytic gastritis, eosinophilic gastritis, chronic atrophic gastritis, and chronic hypertrophic gastropathy are disorders that cause longterm gastritis."

    "text": "Diagnosing malabsorption can be complex, because longterm diarrhea and weight loss are signs that are common in several diseases, including malabsorption. An exact diagnosis may take more than a single visit. A thorough examination is needed for dogs with signs of malabsorption to determine whether the signs are caused by an underlying generalized or metabolic disease. Certain tests can help determine whether the signs are due to a condition such as inflammatory bowel disease (see above), liver disease, or parasites. The dog’s history is particularly important because it may suggest a specific food allergy, consumption of non-food items, or other sensitivity. Weight loss may indicate malabsorption or protein-losing disease but may also be due to loss of appetite, vomiting, or a non‑digestive disease. There are certain features that help distinguish small-intestinal diarrhea from large-intestinal diarrhea. Suspected large intestine disease in dogs may be further evaluated by a biopsy of the intestinal lining. However, if signs are accompanied by weight loss or large volumes of feces, then the small intestine is probably also affected. Initial tests usually include blood, urine, and fecal tests, x-rays, and an abdominal ultrasound. Specialized blood tests and tissue biopsies may also be necessary."

If malabsorption is caused by exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, treatment involves feeding a special low-fiber diet that contains moderate levels of fat or highly digestible fat, very digestible carbohydrate, and high-quality protein. Supplementation with pancreatic extract to provide missing enzymes is also necessary. If the dog’s response to pancreatic replacement treatment is poor, small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth may be suspected. In this case, the dog may be treated with oral antibiotics for about 1 month to reduce the bacterial overgrowth. Effective treatment of small-intestinal disease depends on the nature of the disorder, but when a specific diagnosis cannot be made, treatments may be given on a trial basis."

The intestinal form of the disease is difficult to treat effectively. Antibiotics are not always recommended, due to concerns about the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, as well as concerns about the effects of antibiotics on normal intestinal bacteria of dogs. Although the signs of disease may disappear, eliminating the bacteria from the body is difficult, particularly in adult dogs."

If pups less than 3 months old eat the eggs that have been in the environment for at least 4 weeks, the eggs hatch, releasing larvae that penetrate the intestinal wall. The larvae migrate through the liver, reach the lungs via the bloodstream, are coughed up, swallowed, and mature to egg-producing adults in the small intestine. Many larvae will be carried by the bloodstream to other parts of the dog’s body and remain in the tissues of the dog for years in an inactive form. If immune system suppression occurs, these larvae can become active."

Transmission may result when larvae are ingested or, in the case of A. caninum, from the colostrum or milk of infected dogs. Infections with Ancylostoma species can also result from larval invasion through the skin. Skin penetration in young pups is followed by migration of the larvae through the blood to the lungs, where they are coughed up and swallowed to mature in the small intestine. However, in animals more than 3 months old, larvae may remain in the body tissues in a state of arrested development. These larvae are activated after removal of adult worms from the intestine or during pregnancy, when they accumulate in the small intestine or mammary glands of the mother."

Surviving puppies develop some immunity and show less severe signs. Nevertheless, malnourished and weakened animals may continue to grow poorly and suffer from longterm anemia. Mature, well-nourished dogs may harbor a few worms without showing signs; these dogs are often the direct or indirect source of infection for pups. Diarrhea with dark, tarry feces accompanies severe infections. Anemia, loss of appetite, weight loss, and weakness develop in longterm disease. Pneumonia may occur in pups with overwhelming infections, making breathing difficult."

A test is available for the identification of the amoeba in humans and may be used for diagnosis in dogs and other animals."

In those few cases when it appears the cancer has not yet spread, your veterinarian may attempt surgical removal. However, it is difficult to completely remove such tumors and surgery is often unsuccessful. Both chemotherapy and radiation treatment have shown little success in human or veterinary patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Thus, the outlook for dogs with pancreatic adenocarcinoma is grave."

Signs may include vomiting, depression, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fever, diarrhea, and dehydration. In some animals, a mass in the abdomen can be felt. Dogs may respond favorably to surgical drainage of the abscess. However, the risks and expense of surgery may outweigh the benefit, unless there is clear evidence of an enlarging mass or bacterial infection. Your veterinarian will make a surgical recommendation based on your dog’s specific condition, overall health, and related considerations."

Treatment is likely to include intravenous fluids to correct dehydration and electrolyte (salt) imbalances. Enemas may be used to cleanse the intestines of ammonia and other poisons, and to introduce nutrients that help decrease poison production. Medications to affect the bacterial populations in the gut may also be used to reduce the absorption of toxic products, such as ammonia. Once the dog has been stabilized, treatment is aimed at preventing recurrence. A protein-modified restricted diet may be prescribed. The signs of hepatic encephalopathy can be worsened by intestinal bleeding, infections, certain drugs (such as corticosteroids and sedatives), cancer, low blood sugar, fever, kidney disease, dehydration, and constipation. Your veterinarian may prescribe additional treatments to address these concerns."

In patients with liver disease, ascites is caused by a combination of high blood pressure in the liver, low levels of protein in the blood, and an imbalance in sodium and water metabolism. The first step in the control of ascites is restriction of sodium in the dog’s diet. However, sodium-restricted diets alone are often not sufficient, and diuretics (medications that promote loss of fluid by the kidneys) may also be needed. If ascites interferes with breathing, appetite, or comfort, fluid can be removed from the abdomen using a long needle in a process called abdominocentesis. Periodic abdominocentesis can also be used if ascites does not respond to treatment with medication."

In this case, new blood vessels open to bypass the liver and connect to the blood system of the rest of the body, where the blood pressure is lower.

These infections ascend from the intestinal tract, often due to slow movement of bile, gallstones, or other biliary tract disorders. The condition, called cholangiohepatitis, is rare in dogs. Antibiotics are needed to treat the infection, and surgery can be necessary, depending on the cause."

Diabetic dogs have an increased risk for inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), which can lead to some types of liver disease. Some diabetic dogs will develop hepatocutaneous syndrome, which is often deadly. They can also have an increased risk of developing fatty degeneration of the liver because diabetes mellitus increases the metabolism and mobilization of lipids. Lipids include any of a group of water-soluble fats and fat-like chemical substances that are sources of fuel for the body. However, when too many lipids are deposited in the liver, the function of the organ is impaired. Insulin replacement may or may not correct this storage problem."

However, in dogs with vacuolar hepatopathy, abnormal amounts of glycogen accumulate within liver cells, distending them. It is a common liver syndrome that is typically revealed with the results of a liver tissue biopsy. The syndrome is often associated with excessive adrenal gland function (hyperadrenocorticism) or with longterm stress, illnesses, inflammation, or cancer. Certain drugs can also stimulate this syndrome. The presence of glycogen-distended liver cells may also be present in dogs with nodular hyperplasia and certain types of liver cancer. Veterinarians will determine and treat the underlying cause of these liver changes. They may also recommend a change in dog food, the addition of a vitamin supplement, or other treatments. A form of this syndrome is common in Scottish Terriers. Affected dogs of this breed can slowly or rapidly develop severe liver conditions, such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, or liver failure."

Several medications have been shown to provide effective treatment. Your pet may also be prescribed stool softeners to reduce painful defecation. Antibiotics (if prescribed) and cleansing the anal area may reduce inflammation. For your pet’s comfort, follow all treatment instructions carefully."

They can be harmless (benign) tumors or aggressive (malignant) tumors that spread to other parts of the body. Male dogs that have not been neutered are 3–10 times more likely to develop perianal tumors than females, depending on the type of tumor. Neutering these dogs will cause most benign tumors to resolve. Surgery is necessary to remove malignant tumors. Radiation and chemotherapy may also be necessary. The outlook for malignant tumors is unknown."

If your pet is an unneutered male, neutering may be recommended to reduce the chance of recurrence. In up to half of affected dogs, perianal hernias will happen again. Surgery is required to repair the hernia. Postoperative complications such as infection, nerve damage, and other anal or rectal problems can occur."

Tiny skin mites burrow under a dog’s skin, often on the edges of the ears, and can cause intense itching. Because they are so hard to see and find, a veterinarian might take several skin scrapings before making a diagnosis. The type of insect or parasite that is causing the inflammation varies depending on the season, environment, and geographical location. They include ticks, mosquitoes, flies, and fleas. Treatment includes controlling the insects or parasites in the environment, insecticides, repellents, and medications to reduce inflammation and itching."

It is an uncommon disorder of puppies and is characterized by masses of small, round raised areas of inflamed skin filled with pus on the face and ears. The lymph nodes below the lower jaw are usually noticeably enlarged. It occurs in puppies 3 weeks to 4 months of age and rarely in older animals. Golden Retrievers, Gordon Setters, and Dachshunds appear to be at greater risk than other breeds. An inflamed, pus-filled, raised area of the skin of the ear canal is common, along with swollen, thickened pinnae. Some dogs will also stop eating, be lethargic, or have a fever. Early treatment is recommended to avoid scarring. Careful observation of the condition of your puppies will help you detect any masses or lumps on their faces or ears. Any lumps or masses, even small ones, are a good reason to take your puppy in for a checkup as soon as possible."

Allergies often lead to ear canal infections, which can extend to the pinna (outer ear). Other parts of the body (face, armpits, groin, and feet) are also often affected. Veterinarians diagnose allergies based on the dog's signs and history and by ruling out other causes. Food allergies are diagnosed or ruled out with a strict diet trial, which must adhere closely to the veterinarian's directions. Therapy includes \"allergy shots\" (called allergen-specific immunotherapy), treatments for skin and ear infections, diet changes, and medications. Allergies are longterm conditions that usually require life-long management."

This inflammation, called contact dermatitis, can develop 1–7 days after starting a treatment. The skin of the pinna can become red and swollen and have bumps or sores. Some dogs will also be itchy or in pain. Veterinarians typically treat the condition by stopping all ointments or other topical medications. Switching to a new ointment is unlikely to help, because most products contain similar inactive ingredients."

The cause for their development is unknown, but head shaking or ear scratching due to itchiness is usually involved. In dogs, the condition is seen with environmental or food allergies in which the ear canals are the primary sites of allergic inflammation and itching. Treatment usually involves surgery to drain and flush the swellings. Frequently, the veterinarian will place a drain made out of a soft tube in the area to help prevent fluid from building up again. Medications may also be prescribed."

    "text": "The tubular portion of the outer ear that carries sound to the eardrum is called the ear canal. The most common disorder of the ear canal in dogs is called otitis externa. This condition occurs when the layer of cells that line the external ear canal becomes inflamed. Signs include headshaking, odor, redness of the skin, swelling, scratching, increased discharge, and scaly skin. The ear canal may be painful or itchy depending on the cause or duration of the condition. One or both ears can be affected, and signs can be sudden or longterm. Otitis externa can be caused by many different factors. Some of these factors (such as parasites, foreign objects, and allergies) appear to directly cause the inflammation, while others (such as certain bacteria, yeasts, or a middle ear infection) perpetuate the condition. To complicate things further, the shape or form of the pinnae or ear canals can predispose dogs to developing otitis externa. Identifying these factors is key to successful control of the inflammation. Unless all the causes are identified and treated, the condition may return. Based on these factors, your veterinarian can determine whether the condition can be cured or if longterm or lifelong treatments are necessary."

The frequency of cleaning usually decreases over time from daily to once or twice weekly as a preventive maintenance procedure. The ear canals should be kept dry and well ventilated. Using drying agents in the ears of dogs that swim frequently and preventing water from entering the ear canals during bathing should minimize softening of the ear canal and decrease the frequency of bacterial or fungal infections in moist ear canals. (Softening impairs the barrier function of the skin, which makes it easier for infection to start.) In some cases, clipping or plucking hair from the inside of the pinna and around the ear canal improves ventilation and decreases humidity in the ears. However, you should check with your veterinarian before removing any hair because it can lead to inflammation. Hair should not be removed if it is not causing a problem. If plucking ear canal hair is warranted, be sure to get a demonstration of how to do this correctly."

    "text": "Inflammation of the middle ear structures (otitis media) is usually caused by an extension of infection from the external ear canal or by penetration of the eardrum by a foreign object. The spread of infection through the bloodstream to these areas is also possible, but it is rare. Inflammation of the middle ear may lead to inflammation of the inner ear structures (otitis interna). This can in turn lead to loss of balance and deafness."

If otitis interna occurs at the same time, head tilt toward the affected side will be more obvious. Additionally, an animal with inflammation of the inner ear may have an overall lack of coordination severe enough to cause difficulty in rising and walking. An involuntary rhythmic movement of the eyes from side to side (called nystagmus) may also be seen with inflammation of the inner ear. If the inflammation spreads to the brain, neurologic signs can be seen."

The cornea is a clear dome on the front surface of the eye that lets light in. The cornea not only protects the front of the eye, but also helps focus light on the retina at the back of the eye. The iris is the circular, colored area of the eye. It controls the amount of light that enters the eye by making the pupil larger or smaller. The pupil is the black area in the middle of the eye. The pupil is controlled by the circular sphincter muscle. When the environment is dark, the pupil enlarges to let in more light; when the environment is bright, the pupil becomes smaller to let in less light."

Small muscles (ciliary muscles) contract to cause the lens to become thicker, which allows the lens to focus on nearby objects. The ciliary muscles relax to cause the lens to become thinner when it focuses on distant objects. These lens changes are limited in dogs. The retina contains the cells that sense light (photoreceptors). The most sensitive area of the retina is called the area centralis in dogs; this area contains thousands of tightly packed photoreceptors that make visual images sharp. Each photoreceptor is attached to a nerve fiber. All the nerve fibers are bundled together to form the optic nerve. The photoreceptors in the retina convert the image into electrical impulses, which are carried to the brain by the optic nerve."

Supportive therapy of hot packing and frequent cleansing is often used in severe cases. Your veterinarian will recommend a treatment program designed to control the generalized condition, make your pet more comfortable, and treat the eye condition. Be sure you thoroughly understand the treatment program your veterinarian recommends. Do not hesitate to ask for detailed instructions regarding any eye drops or other medication you will need to give to your pet. It is often helpful to have the veterinarian demonstrate the administration of these medications."

In this disorder, the gland of the nictitating membrane thickens, slips out of its proper place, and sticks out over the edge of the membrane. The resulting red, swollen mass next to the lower eyelid leads to the name “cherry eye.” A pus-filled discharge may also be seen. Although the swelling may go down for short periods, the nictitating membrane gland often remains dislocated."

It results in watering eyes, conjunctivitis that is resistant to treatment, and occasionally a draining opening in the middle of the lower eyelid. If your veterinarian suspects an obstruction of the duct, he or she may attempt to unblock it by flushing it with sterile water or a saline solution. X-rays of the skull after injection of a dye into the duct may be necessary to determine the site, cause, and outlook of longterm obstructions. The usual therapy consists of keeping the duct unblocked and using eyedrops containing antibiotics. When the tear duct has been irreversibly damaged, surgery may be necessary to create a new drainage pathway to empty tears into the nasal cavity, sinus, or mouth."

There may also be slow-healing sores and scarring on the cornea. In dogs, it is often associated with an autoimmune inflammation of both the tear and nictitans glands. Less frequent causes of dry eye in dogs are distemper (a viral disease), therapy with sulfonamide antibiotics, heredity, and injury. To treat this condition, your veterinarian may prescribe eye medications to increase tear production (such as cyclosporine), increase moisture (artificial tear solutions), and reduce mucus. If there are no sores on the cornea, an antibiotic-corticosteroid combination may be added. An additional medication may be added if the dry eye is due to a neurologic condition. In long-term dry eye resistant to medical therapy, surgery may be required to correct the condition. In general, the condition requires longterm—often lifelong—use of eye medications."

It is common in German Shepherds, Belgian Tervurens, Border Collies, Greyhounds, Siberian Huskies, and Australian Shepherds. The signs and amount of inflammation seen can change with age, season, and amount of time the dog spends outside. Treatment for pannus consists of topical corticosteroids and/or cyclosporine (usually given as eye drops). Because this disease is caused by the immune system, treatment needs to be continued for the rest of your pet's life. Any underlying or concurrent conditions, such as bacterial infections or dry eye, will also need to be treated. Routine veterinary examinations are needed to monitor your pet’s response to the treatment and make adjustments as required."

Sudden, severe bleeding usually has a good outcome if the cause is identified and treated promptly. Recurrent or longterm hyphema has an unknown or poor outlook because glaucoma or blindness is likely. Although no drugs are available to treat hyphema directly, certain medications may help relieve the signs."

    "text": "Dogs, like people, can develop glaucoma. Glaucoma occurs when an imbalance in production and drainage of fluid in the eye (aqueous humor) causes a buildup of fluid that increases eye pressure to unhealthy levels. The increased pressure can cause the destruction of the retina and optic disk (the spot where the optic nerve enters the eye). Open-angle glaucoma is a painless and gradual development of blind spots or loss of vision over a long period of time. Closed-angle glaucoma is a sudden increase in eye pressure with severe pain, redness, and loss of vision. Glaucoma occurs in about 1.7% of the dogs in North America. The frequency of breed-predisposed glaucoma in both eyes in purebred dogs is the highest of any animal species, except humans."

    "text": "Most dogs with early to moderate longterm glaucoma are not taken to the veterinarian because the early signs—sluggish to slightly dilated pupils, mild congestion of the veins in the conjunctiva, and early enlargement of the eye—are so subtle that owners are not aware of the changes. To detect early glaucoma, a veterinarian uses an instrument called a tonometer to measure the pressure within the eye. This is often done for high-risk breeds of dogs as part of the general physical examination. Dogs with sudden, severe glaucoma typically have very high eye pressure; a dilated, unmoving or slow-moving pupil; redness in the white of the eyes; swelling and discoloration of the cornea; and a firm eye globe."

The choice of medical or surgical treatment or, most frequently, a combination of both, depends on the type of glaucoma present. It is important to decrease the pressure within the eye as quickly as possible in order to minimize damage. Drugs that can draw fluid out of the eye and others that decrease production of fluid are often prescribed. After the pressure is lowered, it must be stabilized to prevent future problems. Dogs with end-stage glaucoma with an enlarged, blind eye may need for it to be removed by surgery to relieve pain. Your veterinarian will be able to suggest the appropriate medical and/or surgical treatment for your pet. Most glaucomas require longterm management."

Retinal dysplasia is thought to be inherited in American Cocker Spaniels, Beagles, Labrador Retrievers, Rottweilers, and Yorkshire Terriers. Small areas of retinal dysplasia may not cause any signs, or they may interfere with vision. Generalized retinal dysplasia with detachment of the retina, visual impairment, or blindness is inherited in English Springer Spaniels, Bedlington Terriers, Sealyham Terriers, Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers, and Australian Shepherds. Other eye abnormalities, including abnormally small eyes and cataracts that are present at birth, often occur together with the generalized forms of retinal dysplasia. In Labrador Retrievers and Samoyeds, retinal dysplasia may be associated with abnormal shortness of the front legs."

The chances of a good outcome depend on the severity of the injury, the breed of dog, depth of the eye socket, the condition of the eye and how long it was displaced, and other damage near the eye. The eyeball should be put back in place surgically as soon as possible if the animal is in good enough health to have general anesthesia. Treatment includes antibiotics (given by mouth or injection, as well as topical ointments or creams) to prevent infection. Occasionally other medications are needed as well."

Adenocarcinomas of the eyelid glands are locally invasive and harmful but are not known to spread elsewhere throughout the body. Lid melanomas, seen as spreading colored masses on the eyelid, are usually surgically removed. Other frequent eyelid tumors include histiocytoma, mastocytoma, and papilloma.

The longterm survival in affected dogs is often poor, because about 90% of these tumors are malignant and about 75% arise within the orbit. A veterinarian will determine the type of tumor and the extent of the mass through physical examination, skull x-rays, and ultrasonography before surgical removal or radiation of the tumor. Computed tomography (CT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be necessary to fully determine the extent of the tumor. Surgically removing the orbital mass with the eyeball and all orbital tissues (including nearby bone) may decrease the possibility of recurrence, but the procedure will significantly change the appearance of your dog. Using chemotherapy in addition to surgery may help prolong survival time by 6 months or more."

Fortunately, these types of melanomas do not often spread to other parts of the body. Adenoma and adenocarcinoma of the tissue and muscle that surround the lens are the most frequent tumors of the outer layer of the uvea. Signs may include blood vessel ruptures within the anterior chamber of the eye, glaucoma, and usually a white to pink mass behind the iris and in the pupil. Treatment is usually removal of the eyeball. Recent studies in melanomas of the iris, especially in Labrador Retrievers, suggest noninvasive laser surgery may be effective and can be repeated if necessary.

The physical examination includes using a stethoscope to listen to the sounds made by the dog’s internal organs, especially the heart, lungs, and abdominal organs, and examining parts of the body by feeling with hands and fingers to distinguish between solid and fluid-filled swellings and to examine pulses. Imaging techniques include x-rays; electrocardiography (recording electrical activity of the heart); and echocardiography (a type of ultrasonography). Most cardiovascular diseases can be highly suspected by physical examination and x-rays. X-rays are also used to monitor the progression of congestive heart failure. Electrocardiography is specific for diagnosis of arrhythmias. Echocardiography is excellent for confirming tentative diagnoses, for assessing the severity of leaky heart valves or narrowed vessels, for evaluating chamber sizes and heart muscle function, for diagnosing high blood pressure in the lungs, for identifying birth defects in the heart, for detecting heart tumors, or for detecting pericardial disease (problems with the membrane surrounding the heart). Occasionally, more specialized tests such as cardiac catheterization (using a thin flexible tube inserted and threaded through an artery into the heart) or nuclear studies (x‑ray tests that include injection of radioactive isotopes) are necessary. Heartworm disease is diagnosed best by performing a blood test to detect the presence of female heartworms."

    "text": "Aortic stenosis causes thickening of the muscle fibers of the left ventricle. A major effect of this thickening of the muscle fibers is the creation of areas of poor blood flow throughout the heart. When the supply of blood to the heart muscle is low, the heart does not get enough oxygen and is unable to rid itself of carbon dioxide and other cellular waste products. This condition is a major factor in the development of life-threatening ventricular rhythm problems."

In other cases, animals with no history of illness may die suddenly and the defect is detected only after death. Sometimes a murmur can be detected with a stethoscope. If stenosis is suspected, the veterinarian may check the electrical activity of the heart using electrocardiography. In cases where a dog faints frequently or shows other signs of possible heart rhythm problems, the veterinarian may monitor heart activity over a full day. Other tests, such as x-rays or ultrasonography, may also be used."

Because food can not pass properly through the esophagus, affected animals will regurgitate. The undigested food is easily inhaled, leading to aspiration pneumonia. X-rays are used to diagnose the condition, and computed tomography (a CT scan) may be necessary to prepare for surgery to free the esophagus. Persistent right aortic arch has been reported in cattle, horses, cats, and dogs. German Shepherds and Irish Setters develop this abnormality more frequently than other breeds."

Blood shunted into the right ventricle is recirculated through the blood vessels in the lungs and left heart chambers, which causes enlargement of these structures. The right ventricle may enlarge as well. Significant shunting through the pulmonary arteries can induce narrowing of these vessels, leading to reduced blood flow or increased blood pressure. As resistance rises, the shunt may reverse (that is, become a right-to-left shunt) and flow from the right ventricle to the left, bypassing the lungs."

    "text": "The cardiovascular system maintains normal blood pressure and blood flow. In heart disease, the body uses specific mechanisms to attempt to normalize these functions and offset the negative effects the disease is having on the body. In an animal with dilated cardiomyopathy, for example, the blood flow is slowed by the heart’s reduced ability to contract. This leads to a reduced blood pressure because less blood is pumped with each beat. The body compensates by using the sympathetic nervous system to increase the ability of the heart muscle to contract and to increase heart rate. These effects fade within a few days, after which hormonal mechanisms activate. These responses increase cardiac output, blood pressure, blood volume, and blood flow. Blood volume can increase as much as 30% in pets with severe congestive heart failure. These remarkable mechanisms allow for an animal to compensate for mild, then moderate, and then even severe disease, often for years. Eventually, progressive heart muscle failure and longterm activation of these hormones in an effort to normalize blood flow result in damage to the heart and other organs and heart muscle failure. Blood flow becomes further compromised with progressive signs of congestive heart failure."

    "text": "Signs associated with heart failure depend on the causes of the heart failure and the heart chamber that is affected. With left-sided congestive heart failure, signs are associated with a backup of pressure in the vessels delivering blood to the left ventricle. This causes fluid to accumulate within the lungs (called pulmonary edema). Coughing, difficulty breathing, and exercise intolerance (fatigue with trouble breathing associated with exercise) are the most common signs. Many dogs with left-sided congestive heart failure faint due to lack of blood flow and oxygen to the brain. They may also have a low heart rate and low blood pressure and may collapse. Dogs with left-sided congestive heart failure often breathe faster than healthy dogs. Your veterinarian may direct you to count the number of breaths your dog takes within a minute when it is sleeping or resting. This sleeping respiratory rate can then be regularly monitored to identify early heart failure and assess whether your dog is responding to treatment."

When regurgitation is severe, the atrial pressure may also increase. If the mitral valve is affected, the result is elevated blood pressure in the capillaries of the lungs and, if the pressure is high enough, fluid in the lungs. If the tricuspid valve is affected, elevated blood pressure in the body’s veins occurs, and accumulation of fluid in the abdomen may develop. Further damage to the heart can occur due to the continued high-speed flow of blood back into the atrium and also to the body’s attempts to compensate for the decreased blood flow. At the end stage of the heart disease, these compensatory mechanisms become harmful rather than beneficial."

In the past, about 65% died within 8 weeks of diagnosis of heart failure; however, pimobendan may now prolong survival for months for some dogs. The outlook in other breeds is better but remains guarded—75% die within 6 months of diagnosis. Dogs with severe heart failure, particularly left-sided congestive heart failure, have a worse outlook than those with milder signs or signs of right-sided congestive heart failure."

This can lead to decreased blood flow and volume, accumulation of fluid in the chest and lungs, and the formation of blood clots. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is seen rarely in small dogs. Signs may include those of heart failure (coughing, difficulty breathing), collapse, and paralysis of the back legs; sometimes no signs are noted. Treatment should include medication to relieve signs of congestive heart failure, restore heart muscle function, and prevent blood clots."

It is restricted primarily to the right side of the heart, but may also involve the left ventricle. It is characterized by a fibrous and fatty muscle of the right ventricle causing progressive heart muscle failure. Most commonly, Boxers will collapse because of an extremely fast arrhythmia that prevents blood from reaching the brain. Difficulty breathing, increased breathing rate, and nonspecific signs such as loss of appetite and lethargy may also be seen. Some dogs will also develop dilated cardiomyopathy. Treatment includes medications to prevent arrhythmias. The outlook for dogs without dilated cardiomyopathy is good; with treatment, dogs can live for years. However, most dogs in heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy only live several months."

Possible causes include increased pulmonary blood flow (caused by, for example, a ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, or an atrial septal defect), increased resistance to blood flow within the lungs, or low blood levels of oxygen (hypoxemia) due to respiratory disease. Other causes include abnormalities of the blood vessels in the lungs, which may be caused by heartworm disease, narrowing of the arteries within the lungs, or blood clots within the lungs. Primary pulmonary hypertension is rare in dogs. Signs are similar to those seen in right-sided congestive heart failure, such as accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. A swollen and pulsating jugular vein may be noted. Doppler echocardiography (ultrasonography) is the most likely method of confirming the diagnosis. Treatment is usually not effective, and the outlook is often poor, depending on the cause. The best chance for a successful outcome is the identification and treatment of the underlying disease. For example, eliminating heartworms can reduce pulmonary blood pressure and resolve heart failure in dogs with heartworm disease. Reducing the number of red blood cells in a dog with right-to-left patent ductus arteriosus can also help. A newer drug called sildenafil may also help some dogs with pulmonary hypertension, but it is expensive."

Once the larvae arrive in a new host, they grow into adult worms in several months and live in the blood vessels that serve the heart and lungs. In advanced infections, the heartworms enter the heart as well. The presence of parasites stresses the dog’s heart and causes inflammation of the blood vessels and lungs. In addition, severe complications are possible when the number of worms present becomes high or when the heartworms die. Susceptible animals can be reinfected numerous times, so different stages of heartworm infections may be present in the same animal."

The presence of heartworms in the vessels serving the heart and lungs, and in the heart itself, causes irritation and inflammation of the affected vessels or heart chamber. In addition, the dog's immune system does further damage to the blood vessels, especially in response to dead worms. With longterm infection (over 1 year in duration), the constant irritation will lead to scarring and reduced flexibility of the blood vessels. Heartworms typically live for 3–5 years in an animal's body."

This test is easy to perform and is considered the most accurate test available for dogs. However, this test cannot identify early infections because it can only identify adult, female worms. This is part of the reason your veterinarian will likely recommend that this test be performed every year. Other diagnostic tools include echocardiography (a type of ultrasonography), blood tests, and chest x-rays. Your veterinarian will select tests based on your history of use of preventive medication and the overall health of the dog."

Severely affected dogs may need medications to stabilize heart and lung disease before heartworm treatment."

    "text": "The only drug currently available to treat infection with adult heartworms is melarsomine dihydrochloride, an arsenical compound. Appropriate treatment kills both mature and some immature heartworms. There are 2 approved treatment protocols, or methods, used for treating existing infections; a 2-dose protocol or a 3-dose protocol. In both cases the medication is delivered by injection deep into the muscles of the dog’s back, alternating sides of the back between treatments. About one-third of dogs will have some local pain, swelling, soreness with movement, or rarely a sterile abscess at the sites of the injections. The 2-dose protocol consists of 2 doses, 24 hours apart. The 3-dose protocol introduces a delay in the treatment schedule. Under this schedule, the dog would first receive a single injection. One month later, the second and third injections will be administered 24 hours apart. Many veterinarians choose to use the 3-injection treatment, regardless of the dog’s stage of heartworm disease, because it may be safer for the dog and more efficient at killing all the parasites."

The signs of post-treatment complications include coughing, spitting up blood, labored or rapid breathing, lethargy, lack of appetite, and fever. In dogs with complications of heartworm treatment, cage confinement, with several days of oxygen treatment and drugs to control inflammation and reduce blood clotting, may help alleviate the problem. If properly cared for, most dogs begin to recover from treatment complications within 24 hours."

All or part of a clot may break off and be carried through the bloodstream as an embolus that lodges someplace else at a point of narrowing. Blockage of a blood vessel can also occur when foreign material (for example, bacteria, air, or fat) is carried into the bloodstream. Some clots are infected. Life-threatening blood clots are most commonly encountered in animals with underlying diseases that affect the blood’s ability to clot. If left untreated or uncontrolled, these conditions can result in a tendency to bleed and/or a life-threatening condition in which small blood clots develop throughout the bloodstream, blocking small blood vessels and depleting the platelets and clotting factors needed to control bleeding."

If the levels of the thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland are abnormally low, the levels of thyroid hormones will also be low even if the thyroid gland is healthy.

The adrenal gland can also be destroyed by other conditions, including medications used to treat Cushing disease and cancer in other parts of the body. Secretion of aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, is reduced, which affects the levels of potassium, sodium, and chloride in the blood. Potassium gradually builds up in the blood and, in severe cases, may cause the heart to slow down or beat irregularly. Some dogs have such a slow heart rate (50 beats per minute or lower) that they can become weak or go into shock. Decreased production of glucocorticoids (such as cortisol) results in moderately low blood sugar. Dogs with atypical Addison disease can have low blood levels of cortisol but normal levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride."

Although signs can be hard to identify while Addison disease is developing, severe consequences, such as shock and evidence of kidney failure, can develop suddenly. The condition may be inherited in Standard Poodles, West Highland White Terriers, Great Danes, Bearded Collies, Portuguese Water Dogs, and a variety of other breeds. Although the disease can be seen in any breed, sex, or age, it is most common in young, female, adult dogs."

The diagnosis is confirmed by specific evaluation of adrenal function. This is done by measuring the level of cortisol in the blood, treating the dog with adrenocorticotropin (a hormone that stimulates the adrenal gland in healthy animals), and then measuring the level of cortisol in the blood a second time. Affected dogs have low baseline cortisol levels, and there is little response to administration of adrenocorticotropin."

Insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus are also seen in many dogs with Cushing disease ( see Cushing Disease). Longterm treatment with glucocorticoids or progestins can make an animal more likely to develop diabetes mellitus. During pregnancy and during heat cycles, unspayed female dogs produce the hormone progesterone, which can lead to high blood sugar and insulin resistance. Obesity increases the risk of insulin resistance. Increased glucagon also appears to contribute to development of high blood sugar by releasing liver stores of glucose. Stress, obesity, and the use of certain drugs (glucocorticoids and progestogens) can increase signs of diabetes."

    "text": "The pituitary gland is located near the center and bottom of the brain. It produces a number of critical hormones that control many parts of the body, including several other endocrine glands. Because of this central role, it is sometimes called a “master gland.” Because large numbers of hormones are produced by the pituitary gland, a variety of different conditions can be caused by pituitary disease or tumors. The specific illness and signs depend on the cause and the area(s) of the pituitary gland that is affected."

Veterinarians will run routine and specialized blood and urine tests on dogs that have signs of Cushing disease. Retesting may be needed 3 to 6 months later if test results are inconclusive or if the dog does not continue to show signs. Once the disease is confirmed, additional laboratory tests are usually done to determine whether the cause is a tumor of the pituitary gland or of the adrenal gland. The pituitary and adrenal glands can be further evaluated using abdominal x-rays, ultrasonography, or more sophisticated methods of diagnostic imaging such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)."

    "text": "The classic treatment for hyperadrenocorticism is with mitotane, a drug that acts on the adrenal glands to decrease the production of cortisol. Dogs should be monitored for signs that the cortisol level has dropped too low, such as reduced appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea. After 7 to 10 days of treatment, a test may be performed to determine if cortisol levels are low enough. Often, mitotane treatment is continued, with blood tests done every 3–4 months to monitor cortisol levels. Gradually increasing doses of mitotane are often needed to keep the disease under control. Adverse effects of mitotane can include vomiting and loss of appetite, lack of coordination, weakness, seizures, and mildly low blood sugar. Some of these effects may stop if the daily dose is divided into 2 equal parts and given 8 to 12 hours apart."

They can detect very small changes in the carbon dioxide and oxygen content and pH of the blood, and they help regulate breathing and circulation. Tumors in chemoreceptor tissue usually develop principally in either the aortic body (found in the chest) or in the carotid bodies (found in the neck). Tumors of the aortic and carotid bodies are seen most often in brachycephalic breeds of dogs, such as Boxers and Boston Terriers. The tumors do not secrete excess hormone but may cause problems by placing pressure on the heart, blood vessels, and nerves. Aortic body tumors are more common but are less likely to spread to other parts of the body (metastasize) than carotid body tumors."

Others, including the spleen and lymph nodes, trap microorganisms and foreign substances and provide a place for immune system cells to collect, interact with each other and with foreign substances, and generate an immune response."

In order to do this, the immune system must distinguish between “self” and “non-self.” By recognizing invading microorganisms (such as viruses), chemical agents, or other foreign substances that are “non-self,” a body can protect itself from attack. Substances that stimulate an immune response in the body are called antigens. Antigens may be contained within or on bacteria, viruses, other microorganisms, or cancer cells. Antigens may also exist on their own—for example, as pollen or food molecules. A normal immune response consists of recognizing a foreign antigen, mobilizing forces to defend against it, and attacking it."

Acute inflammation is the most important process involved in nonspecific immunity. During inflammation, white blood cells (such as neutrophils and macrophages) rapidly travel from the blood into the tissues to kill invading organisms and remove injured cells. Other white blood cells involved in nonspecific immunity are monocytes (which develop into macrophages), eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells ( see also White Blood Cells of Dogs). These nonspecific types of white blood cells usually act on their own to destroy invaders.

Specific immunity is so named because it tailors its attack to a specific antigen previously encountered. It takes time to develop specific immunity after initial exposure to a new antigen; however, when the antigen is encountered in the future, the response is more rapid and more effective than that generated by nonspecific immunity. Specific immunity involves the action of lymphocytes (B cells and T cells), antibodies, antigen-presenting cells, and cytokines."

Anaphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening, immediate allergic reaction to something that has entered the body (for example, eaten or injected). In a normal immune system, the binding of an antigen to an antibody activates various cells, which produce chemicals such as histamines. In anaphylaxis, the body activates an excessive number of cells, resulting in the production of very large numbers of histamines and other chemicals. These chemicals can affect various organs such as the blood vessels and muscles. The severity of the reaction depends on the type and amount of antigen, the amount of antibodies produced, and the route of exposure. Agents that can cause anaphylactic and allergic reactions include biting insects, vaccines, drugs, food, and blood products. The most common signs include restlessness, excitement, swelling of the face, drooling, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, difficulty breathing, shock, collapse, convulsions, and death."

Relief from itching can be achieved through the use of prescription drugs, therapeutic shampoos, avoiding flare-inducing triggers (such as fleas, allergens, or infections), and \"allergy shots.\" This last treatment, called allergen-specific immunotherapy, consists of an extended series of injections of the offending allergen under the skin until improvement is noted. This type of treatment is effective in 60% of dogs. If your veterinarian prescribes a medication to control your pet’s allergic reactions, be sure to follow the directions carefully and fully, including any restrictions regarding exposure to carpets, chemicals, or other potential hazards.

Red blood cells are manufactured as usual in the bone marrow, but once released into the bloodstream, they are attacked and destroyed by antibodies. Signs of anemia may include fatigue, paleness of the lips and gums, and depression, along with jaundice in some cases. Other signs your veterinarian may find include an enlarged liver or spleen."

One theory is that the skin is somehow altered, making it appear “foreign” to the immune system. In the case of pemphigus foliaceus, the immune system produces antibodies against the “glue” that normally keeps skin cells (keratinocytes) attached to one another. White blood cells move in causing further damage, and the keratinocytes break apart from each other, forming pimples or crusted areas. Veterinarians frequently prescribe corticosteroids for treatment of pemphigus foliaceus, but other immunosuppressive drugs may be added if there is no response."

It can be congenital (present at birth) or immune-mediated, developing later in life. Weakness is the primary sign. Affected animals produce antibodies to certain nerve receptors and destroy them. This leads to the inability to contract muscles and extreme muscle weakness. In older dogs, the first sign of problems may be an enlargement of the esophagus (megaesophagus) due to the muscular weakness. The enlargement of the esophagus leads to difficulty swallowing and can cause regurgitation, which can cause inhalation pneumonia. Myasthenia gravis is diagnosed using blood tests to search for the antibody to the nerve receptor and other tests for nerve activity. Your veterinarian will prescribe drugs to control this disease. Remissions can occur, and many dogs that develop this condition do well with continued treatment."

The immune complexes often form as a consequence of some other disease, such as an infection or cancer. However, in many dogs with glomerulonephritis, the triggering cause cannot be determined. Glomerulonephritis results in an excessive loss of protein in the urine (proteinuria). The finding of protein in the urine during a urine test may be the first indication that your dog has glomerulonephritis. Treatment includes treating any underlying diseases, reducing the amount of protein lost in the urine, managing any existing kidney disease, and giving immunosuppressive drugs to reduce the formation of the immune complexes. If it goes untreated, the disease can lead to chronic kidney failure."

For example, tumors frequently develop in the cavities of flat bones in the skull, ribs, and pelvis and in vertebrae (bones of the spine). Fractures of diseased bones can lead to central nervous system problems, spinal disorders, pain, and lameness. Signs can also be caused by the presence of the monoclonal antibodies themselves. In about 20% of dogs with monoclonal gammopathies, blood changes occur that can cause blood clots, bleeding problems, depression, blindness, and other nervous system signs. In some conditions, the animals develop gangrene and lose portions of the ear tips, eyelids, toes, or tail tip. Normal antibodies can be reduced, resulting in immunodeficiency."

It also maintains the correct balance of water and electrolytes (salts) within the body’s cells. Another key function is the production of hormones called erythropoietin and renin, which are important in maintaining healthy blood pressure, producing blood cells, and absorbing salt correctly.

If your pet has trouble urinating, your veterinarian may also want to perform a neurologic (nerve and brain) examination. There are many other tests a veterinarian might perform in the case of a urinary disorder. These include blood tests, blood pressure tests, urinalysis and other urine tests, x-rays, contrast x-rays (tests in which a special dye is given to outline the urinary tract on the x-ray), ultrasonography, biopsies, and cystoscopic tests. Cystoscopic tests involve inserting a small tube with a camera on the tip into the urethra. This allows the veterinarian to view the inside of the urethra and the bladder.

Urinalysis also tests for the presence of certain chemicals or substances in the urine, such as sugar, ketones (a byproduct of the body’s processing of fat), bilirubin (a pigment produced when the liver processes waste), blood, and protein. The urine sediment is also examined under a microscope to look for things such as red blood cells, white blood cells, other cells, bacteria, crystals, and renal casts (tube-shaped particles that come from the kidney). Urinalysis is best performed on fresh urine samples because delays can cause inaccurate results.

In some animals, however, the urachus does not close properly after birth. Depending on which portion of the urachus remains open, these abnormalities are called a patent urachus or an umbilical urachal sinus. Other problems include urachal diverticula (small sac-like structures attached to the urachus) and urachal cysts. Signs include an inability to control urination, urine scalding (due to the fact that urine is caustic) of the skin near the navel, and urinary tract infections.

The bacteria then travel to the bladder, and in some cases they set up an infection there. Sometimes bacteria continue to move up the urinary tract to the kidneys, which can result in kidney infection (pyelonephritis). There are several factors that increase the risk of urinary system infection. These include problems with urine flow (especially not being able to empty the bladder completely during urination), overly dilute urine, sugar in the urine (often a sign of diabetes mellitus), and a weakened immune system. Female dogs are more prone to urinary tract infections than male dogs. Older, uncastrated male dogs, however, are prone to bacterial infections of the prostate. Dogs with other diseases (such as kidney disease or Cushing disease) have a greater risk for infections. Most bacterial infections of dogs cannot be passed to humans."

Azotemia can be caused by many factors, including kidney disease, dehydration, shock, and congestive heart failure. Azotemia can also occur as a result of urine not being able to flow properly through the urinary tract."

Chronic kidney disease often continues for months or years before a dog has any signs. There is rarely anything that a veterinarian can do to treat existing damage, and they can only slow the progression of (but not prevent) further damage once the process has started. Occasionally, chronic kidney disease results from a problem that is inherited or an abnormality present at birth. Most of the time, however, it is a problem in older animals. Starting at age 5 to 6, kidney disease becomes more common, affecting up to 10% of elderly dogs. Chronic kidney disease that is not inherited does not seem to be more common among certain dog breeds or among males or females."

In Stage I, the kidneys are damaged but azotemia (see above) has not yet developed and the dog has no signs. This is the stage at which treatment has the greatest chance of success, but because the dog has no signs, the disease is rarely diagnosed at this stage. In Stage II, the kidneys filter waste much more slowly than normal, and there is a buildup of waste chemicals in the blood, but many dogs still have no signs. Signs that may be present at this stage include an increase in the amount of water in the urine and an increased volume of urine. In Stage III, filtering slows even more, the waste chemicals are more concentrated in the blood, and the dog develops signs of disease. Stage IV, the final stage, reflects continued kidney damage and accumulation of waste products in the bloodstream. By this time the dog feels and acts very sick."

Approximately 20% of dogs with longterm kidney disease have elevated blood pressure (hypertension), which can cause further damage to the kidneys and also injure the eyes, brain, heart, and blood vessels. The risk of damage to the kidneys and other organs increases as the blood pressure increases. The presence of protein in your dog's urine can indicate that your dog has or may develop kidney disease, body-wide inflammation, metabolic disease, cancer, or infectious diseases. Your veterinarian will perform urine tests to learn how much protein is present, to help determine your dog's treatment and outlook."

Veterinarians may be able to detect a problem in a blood test or on physical examination even before the dog starts to display signs of kidney failure.

The syndrome can appear suddenly and for no apparent reason, or it can be inherited. Basenjis are most likely to inherit the condition; in this case, the condition develops gradually in adults."

Unusually low levels of sex hormones in neutered dogs are another common cause. This type of incontinence, called hormonal--responsive urethral incompetence, is particularly common in female dogs.

Dogs that cannot urinate normally will usually try to urinate often, but the urination will be slow and painful, and only small amounts of urine will come out. Dogs with urine elimination problems may also develop incontinence over time, if the bladder does not empty properly. The bladder can become stretched out and begin to overflow and leak."

However, larger stones in the lower urinary tract may interfere with urination or irritate the lining of the bladder or urethra. In turn, these problems can cause painful urination, blood in the urine, and slow or painful urination. Kidney stones usually cause no signs unless the kidney becomes inflamed or the stones pass into the ureter. If a ureter becomes blocked by a stone, it can cause vomiting, slowness or tiredness, and pain in the abdomen in the area around the kidneys. This sign is particularly common when a ureter is suddenly and completely blocked and a backup of fluids causes the kidney to become enlarged. Pain may be the only sign of stones in the ureter on only one side; however, pain can be difficult to detect in dogs. If the blocked ureter is not diagnosed right away, kidney damage occurs. Ultimately, the blocked kidney is destroyed."

The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide occurs in the alveoli. When this exchange fails or becomes inefficient because of disease, the animal can become seriously ill. The respiratory system protects its own delicate airways by warming and humidifying inhaled air and by filtering out particles. Large airborne particles usually land on the mucous lining of the nasal passages, larynx, trachea, and bronchi, after which they are carried to the throat to be either swallowed or coughed up. Small particles and microorganisms are destroyed by the body’s immune system. The upper airways also provide for the sense of smell and play a role in temperature regulation in animals such as dogs that use panting as a way to help keep cool. The respiratory system also protects the body in other ways."

Low oxygen levels can be caused by reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood cells, reduced blood flow through the lungs and body, insufficient movement of gases in and out of the lungs, or inability of tissues to use available oxygen (a condition caused by some poisons). The animal’s body attempts to compensate for low oxygen in the blood by increasing the depth and rate of breathing, increasing contraction of the spleen (to force more red blood cells into circulation), and increasing blood flow and heart rate. If the brain suffers from lack of oxygen, respiratory function may be reduced even further due to depression of nervous system activity. In addition, heart, kidney, and liver functions may be reduced, as may the normal movement and secretions of the intestine. If the body is not able to compensate for the reduced oxygen level, a “vicious cycle” may begin in which all body tissues function less efficiently."

Hydrothorax, the accumulation of clear fluid in the pleural cavity, is usually due to interference with blood flow or lymph drainage. Chylothorax, the accumulation of a high-triglyceride lymphatic fluid in the pleural cavity, is relatively rare in dogs. It may be caused by rupture of the chest duct but often the cause is unknown. The signs of all 3 conditions include respiratory difficulty, such as rapid shallow breathing with labored inhalation, and weakness. Drainage of the fluid may be necessary to relieve these signs and can be helpful in diagnosing the underlying problem. However, the outlook for many disorders that cause accumulation of fluid in the chest is guarded to poor."

Because it is highly contagious, outbreaks are most common when dogs are in close contact with each other, for example at kennels, shelters, and dog parks. The virus is spread from one dog to another through respiratory secretions (transferred by coughing, sneezing, or barking), contaminated objects (such as water bowls or leashes), and on the hands and clothes of people that have been around an infected dog. It typically takes 2–4 days for dogs to show signs after being exposed to the virus.

In more mild, longterm cases, general signs such as weight loss may be more noticeable than respiratory signs. During an examination, the veterinarian may note the absence of normal lung sounds and/or the presence of digestive system sounds in the chest. Dogs born with a diaphragmatic hernia may not show any signs or may have signs associated with poor respiratory or digestive function."

    "text": "Emphysema is an important disease in humans; however, in other animals it typically occurs as a result of another lung disease. The condition leads to difficulty in expelling air from the lungs, making breathing more difficult. Two major forms of emphysema are generally recognized. Alveolar emphysema is abnormal permanent enlargement and destruction of the alveoli, which are small air sacs deep in the lungs. Interstitial emphysema is the presence of air within the supporting connective tissue of the lung. Chronic obstructive pulmonary (lung) disease (COPD) can cause air to get trapped in the alveoli, causing enlargement and destruction of air spaces. Congenital lobar emphysema of dogs (a condition seen in the Pekingese breed) occurs because of incomplete development of the bronchiolar cartilage. Signs vary depending on the cause of disease. The most common sign is labored breathing. Emphysema is permanent lung damage, so treatment is directed at the disease that caused it. Treatments, such as bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory drugs, can significantly improve breathing ability and other respiratory signs."

A short, moist cough is characteristic of the disease, and a thick discharge of mucous from the nose may be seen. As the disease progresses, labored breathing, weight loss, and generalized weakness develop. During examination, the veterinarian may detect harsh respiratory sounds. In advanced cases, breath sounds are decreased or almost impossible to hear. Inflammation of the lymph nodes can cause compression of the airway, making it difficult for the animal to breathe. Periodic fever can occur. Some fungal infections can cause signs in other parts of the body as well, for example in the skin, bones, and eyes."

Allergic rhinitis or sinusitis occurs seasonally in association with pollen production, and year-round, probably in association with house dusts and molds. Inhalation of smoke or irritant gases, or foreign objects lodged in the nasal passages, also may cause sudden rhinitis."

Tears and inflammation of the membrane surrounding the eyes (conjunctivitis) often accompany inflammation of the upper respiratory passages. The nasal discharge is clear but may become mucus-like or contain pus as a result of secondary bacterial infection. Sneezing, in an attempt to clear the upper airways of discharge, is seen most frequently in acute rhinitis and tends to come and go in cases of chronic rhinitis. Affected dogs may also experience an aspiration reflex (“reverse sneeze”), a short rapid inhalation in an attempt to clear the nose. Tumors, fungal disease, or chronic inflammatory rhinitis can cause a chronic nasal discharge that starts out as 1-sided but becomes 2-sided; another sign is discharge that starts out as mucus or pus but later contains blood. Fungal rhinitis can be painful, causing dogs to be \"head shy\" (that is, avoid having their heads pet)."

When present by itself, it is most frequently seen in small breeds. Chronic tonsillitis may occur in brachycephalic dogs (those bred to have flattened faced and short noses) along with inflammation of the upper throat. Bacteria are a frequent cause of disease. Plant fibers or other foreign bodies that lodge in a tonsil may produce a localized 1-sided inflammation or abscess. Other physical and chemical agents may cause irritation of the mouth and upper throat and one or both tonsils.

Foods, liquids, and drugs all generally undergo metabolic processes within the body. Many foods are complex materials that need to be broken down into simpler substances, which in turn become “building blocks” for the body to use as needed. For example, protein is broken down into amino acids, which are used in several metabolic reactions. Enzymes made by the body are needed for many metabolic processes to occur. Whenever the function of an enzyme is affected, a metabolic disorder can develop. Metabolic disorders are important because they affect energy production or damage tissues. They may be genetic (inherited) or acquired. Acquired metabolic disorders are more common and significant."

    "text": "Some metabolic disorders are caused by an increased demand for a specific element or nutrient that has become deficient under certain conditions. For example, in hypoglycemia, the animal’s metabolic reserves are unable to sustain sugar (or glucose) in the blood at a level needed for normal function. Likewise, in hypocalcemia, the level of calcium in the blood is too low. In some cases, dietary intake of a nutrient, such as calcium, is rapidly used up for an ongoing, high metabolic need, such as lactation (or nursing puppies)."

    "text": "The difference between production-related metabolic diseases and nutritional deficiencies is often subtle. Typically, nutritional deficiencies are longterm conditions that develop gradually and can be corrected through dietary supplementation. Metabolic diseases usually begin suddenly and respond dramatically to administration of the deficient nutrient (although affected animals may need dietary supplements to avoid recurrence). Because production-related metabolic disorders are serious and develop suddenly, accurate and rapid diagnosis is essential. Ideally, diagnostic tests can be used to predict the chance of disease occurring so that either it can be prevented or preparations can be made for rapid treatment."

Other names for this condition include postpartum hypocalcemia, periparturient hypocalcemia, puerperal tetany, and eclampsia. This life-threatening condition is usually seen 2 to 3 weeks after whelping, when the mammary glands are producing the greatest amount of milk. Small-breed dogs with large litters are affected most often, although puerperal hypocalcemia can occur in any breed of dog, with any litter size, and at any time during lactation. The disorder can also occur during labor and cause difficulties in giving birth (dystocia) or, rarely, during late pregnancy. Hypocalcemia most likely results from loss of calcium into the milk and too little calcium in the diet."

Severe tremors, repeated and prolonged contraction of muscles (tetany), rapid heartbeat, fever, seizures, and coma may develop. Severely affected dogs can die because of the condition. Usually, the dog has been otherwise healthy, and the newborns have been thriving. Although hypocalcemia usually occurs after giving birth, clinical signs can appear before or during the act of giving birth. Hypocalcemia can contribute to ineffective contractions and a slow labor without causing other clinical signs."

Puppies should not be allowed to nurse for 12 to 24 hours. During this period, they should be fed a milk substitute or other appropriate diet; if mature enough, they should be weaned. If signs recur in the same lactation, the litter should be hand raised (if younger than 4 weeks) or weaned (if older than 4 weeks). After the acute crisis, calcium supplements are given for the rest of the lactation. Vitamin D supplements also may be used to increase calcium absorption from the intestines. Blood calcium levels are usually monitored weekly."

The anatomical differences in the digestive tract between species are associated with the importance of disorders of magnesium occurring in a particular species. Disorders of magnesium metabolism are less common in dogs than in cattle and sheep. Too much magnesium in the blood (hypermagnesemia) is rare but has been reported in dogs after ingestion of ice melts and in animals with kidney failure that were receiving intravenous fluids. Cardiac arrest can occur with very high blood magnesium levels. Too little magnesium in the blood (hypomagnesemia) is common in critically ill dogs. Although it usually does not cause any signs, hypomagnesemia can worsen other conditions and lead to low blood levels of other important electrolytes, such as potassium and calcium."

Estrogen is necessary for the development of eggs, and progesterone prepares the uterus for pregnancy. Once puberty is reached and the dog starts its heat or estrous cycle, the size and form of the ovaries change. Within the ovary, a group of special cells called a follicle surround each egg. The estrous cycle begins when follicle stimulating hormone stimulates follicles to grow, leading to maturation of eggs and production of the hormone estrogen. Estrogen causes the brain to release luteinizing hormone, which stimulates the release of eggs from the ovary (a process called ovulation). After ovulation, progesterone, produced by the ovary, prepares the uterus for pregnancy and the mammary glands for milk production."

For optimal sperm production, the testes must descend into the scrotum (a pouch of skin outside the abdomen), because regular body temperature is too high for sperm to develop normally.

    "text": "The female genital tract includes the vulva, vagina, cervix, uterus, oviducts, and ovaries. The mammary glands, found on the chest and abdomen, are also part of the reproductive system. The oviducts (also called Fallopian tubes) are small tubes that connect the ovaries to the uterus. The end of the uterus is called the cervix. It separates the uterus from the vagina and provides a barrier against infection. The vagina (a muscular tube that extends from the cervix to the outside) is connected to the vulva (skin surrounding the opening of the vagina). The vulva is the external opening of the female genitals. An oviduct is connected to each ovary. After ovulation, eggs are transported to the uterus via the oviducts. Secretion of fluid in the oviducts provides a proper environment for survival of the mature egg, fertilization, and the first few critical days of embryonic life. Proper functioning of the uterus and cervix are also required for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy."

Infertility in females can be diagnosed through various means, including x-rays, ultrasonography, physical examination, evaluation of vaginal cells and discharge, and blood tests. The vagina and vulva serve as the copulatory organs and as the last part of the birth canal. They also provide a route for infections, particularly when the vulva cannot function properly due to trauma, relaxation, or deformities."

The average interval between cycles is 7 months, but some large breeds (for example, Great Danes) may cycle normally every 9–12 months. The anestrus phase is the nonbreeding portion of the cycle and is marked by inactive ovaries and a small uterus. A female dog in this phase is not attractive to male dogs and will not allow them to mount. The end of anestrus is marked by an increase in luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone. Anestrus normally lasts 1–6 months."

Veterinarians can help time ovulation through the use of physical examinations, hormone testing, and by evaluating cells taken from the vagina (called vaginal cytology). Discuss breeding with your veterinarian before your dog comes into season. Then, notify your veterinarian as soon as you notice evidence of heat, such as vaginal discharge, swelling of the vulva, or attraction to male dogs. Your veterinarian will examine your dog and take appropriate blood or vaginal samples, usually every 2 days. Based on these results, your veterinarian will recommend which days are appropriate for breeding."

They may also have clear, watery discharge from the vagina. During stage II, abdominal contractions can be seen and the puppies are delivered. The puppies are usually delivered at intervals shorter than 1 to 2 hours, but that can vary considerably. Stage II can last up to 24 hours, but normal delivery is typically shorter. Stage III is defined as the delivery of the placenta. Dogs typically alternate between stages II and III until delivery is complete.

It is not necessary that the mother eat the placentas. Disinfection of the umbilicus (belly button) with tincture of iodine helps prevent bacterial infection in the newborn puppies. Puppies should be weighed as soon as they are dry and then twice daily for the first week. Any weight loss after the first 24 hours indicates a potential problem and should be given immediate attention, such as extra feeding, assisted nursing, or examination by a veterinarian ( see Puppy Care).

For best results, ovulation and deposition of semen into the female genital tract must be closely synchronized. Failure of any step in either sex leads to infertility or sterility. The ultimate result of infertility is the failure to produce offspring. In females, infertility may be due to improper timing of breeding (the most common cause), the absence of the estrous cycle, abnormal ovulation, failure to conceive, or prenatal death. Major infertility problems in males are caused by disturbances in the production, transport, or storage of sperm; loss of libido (sexual desire); and partial or complete inability to mate. Most major infertility problems are complex. Often, several factors, singly or in combination, can cause failure to produce offspring."

Because the retained testicles still produce male hormones, these animals have normal mating behavior and sexual characteristics. If only one testicle is retained (unilateral cryptorchidism), the dog can still mate normally, as the one normal testicle will produce normal sperm. Because the condition is inherited, cryptorchid dogs should not be used for breeding. This condition occurs in all breeds but is commonly seen in the Toy and Miniature Poodle, Pomeranian, Dachshund, Chihuahua, Maltese, Boxer, Pekingese, English Bulldog, Miniature Schnauzer, and Shetland Sheepdog.

Other causes of paraphimosis include a constricting band of hair at the preputial opening, a small preputial opening, foreign material around the penis, or other trauma to the penis. Paraphimosis is a medical emergency because the exposed penis quickly becomes swollen (due to accumulation of fluid), dry, and painful. If recognized early, before severe swelling and pain develop, paraphimosis is easily treated. The treatment consists of gentle cleansing and lubrication of the exposed penis. The penis is replaced inside the prepuce and the swelling resolves once circulation is restored. More advanced cases of paraphimosis may require additional treatments or surgery to correct."

It may be hereditary or acquired as a result of trauma, inflammation, or bacterial infection. The signs are variable. Usually, the problem is unnoticed until the dog attempts to mate and is unable to copulate. Diagnosis is established by physical examination of the prepuce and penis. Treatment depends on the severity of the phimosis and the intended use of the dog. If the dog is not used for breeding, treatment probably is not needed, although neutering could be considered to prevent arousal. Surgery to enlarge the opening of the prepuce can be performed for breeding dogs or those that have inflammation or difficulty urinating."

Dehydration and shock may occur in severe cases of prostatic abscesses. The disease is diagnosed by physical examination, x-rays, blood and urine tests, and examination of prostatic fluid. Longterm bacterial prostatitis may cause no signs except for recurrent urinary tract infection. Sudden prostatitis is treated by administration of antibiotics and may require prolonged treatment. Intravenous fluids may be necessary in severe cases. Neutering should be considered after treatment for sudden disease. Longterm prostatitis will only resolve with treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, which involves neutering or medication to shrink the prostate.

Dystocia should be considered in any of the following situations: 1) dogs that have a history of dystocia; 2) birth that does not occur within 24 hours of a drop in rectal temperature to less than 100°F (a sign of impending birth); 3) continuous strong contraction for more than 1–2 hours with no birth; 4) active labor for more than 1 to 2 hours without a birth; 5) a resting period during labor that lasts more than 4 to 6 hours; 6) obvious pain or illness in the mother (for example, crying, licking, or biting of the vulva); and 7) abnormal discharge from the vulvar area. Once the cause is identified, the appropriate treatment can be determined. X-rays or ultrasonography can show how many fetuses are present. Medication may help the labor progress if the mother and fetuses are still in stable condition and there is no obstruction.

In dogs with longterm inflammation, the only sign may be failure for puppies to thrive. The disease is diagnosed based on the physical examination, the dog’s medical history, and evaluation of the dog's milk. Your veterinarian may test for bacteria to determine which antibiotic to use in cases of infective mastitis. Dogs that are dehydrated or in shock may require intravenous fluids. Warm compresses should be applied to the affected glands 4 to 6 times daily, and the puppies should be encouraged to nurse from these glands. An abscessed mammary gland should be lanced, drained, and treated as an open wound."

If pregnancy does not occur for several cycles, the lining inside the uterus continues to thicken and cysts can form within the uterus.

Other important parts of the skin include skin appendages (such as hair and claws) and subcutaneous muscles and fat."

This layer keeps in fluids, salts, and nutrients, while keeping out infectious or noxious agents. The top layer of dead skin cells are continuously shed and replaced by cells from lower layers. The rate of cell replacement is affected by nutrition, hormones, tissue factors, immune cells in the skin, and genetics. Disease, some drugs, and inflammation also alter normal cell growth and keratinization."

Affected dogs are born with normal hair coats but before 1 year of age begin to develop hair follicle inflammation and progressive hair loss in the blue or fawn-colored areas. Black hair follicle dysplasia develops earlier with more complete hair loss in black and white dogs. It develops shortly after birth and affects only the black-colored areas. This syndrome is most common in Papillons and Bearded Collies, and is inherited in Large Munsterlanders. Seasonal flank alopecia can appear in Boxers and Airedale Terriers. Various woolly syndromes and post-clipping alopecia can occur in Spitz-type breeds. Reduced hair growth in Irish Water Spaniels develops at 2 to 4 years of age. Another condition called alopecia X occurs in Pomeranians and other breeds."

In either case, affected animals are at increased risk of skin cancer from solar radiation, especially in areas with short or thin hair. Some animals with extreme piebaldism (spotted or blotched with black and white) or dominant white have associated neurologic anomalies or deafness in one or both ears. In dogs, deafness may also be associated with merle hair coats and is found in Dalmatians, Sealyham Terriers, harlequin Great Danes, Collies, and white Bull Terriers. Rhodesian Ridgebacks with a pale coat color have an association with neurologic disease (specifically, cerebellar degeneration)."

Affected dogs develop bleached splotches of skin that occasionally also affects the hair coat and claws. Most splotches are on the face, especially the bridge of the muzzle or around the eyes. Color loss may come and go with varying amounts of severity. Vitiligo runs in some dog families, especially Belgian Tervurens and Rottweilers. Complete remission may occur but is rare. Vitiligo causes no other health problems. No treatment is available. Treatments used in people with vitiligo are unlikely to help animals."

This causes loose, stretchy, fragile skin, and joint problems. The fragile skin is evident from birth. Wounds heal slowly or not completely. Skin hangs from the body. Cysts and bruising may develop. The disease is not fatal in dogs. Older animals develop hanging folds of skin and exhibit extensive scarring. Some have joint and eye problems. Diagnosis is based on visible signs and biopsies to evaluate the collagen structure. For cats and dogs, a skin extensibility index has been developed to help your veterinarian diagnose this syndrome. There have been some reports of improvement for affected dogs following vitamin C supplements, and your veterinarian will be able to determine whether such supplements might help your pet."

Problems with blood vessels of the skin and muscles occur in the early inflammatory stages of the disease, leading to decreases in size or wasting (atrophy) of those tissues. The onset is typically at younger than 6 months of age. The disease is variable, and individual pups within a litter may be affected differently. Ulcers, crusting, and hair loss appear on the face, ear tips, tail tip, and legs. Heat, sun exposure, and wounds worsen the condition. The muscles most affected are on the head and legs. Diagnosis is established by evaluation of littermates and family history, skin biopsy, electromyography, and muscle biopsy, which must be performed early in the course of the disease. Steroids, pentoxifylline, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids may help. Severely affected dogs rarely respond well to treatment."

However, any dog of any breed (or mixed breeds) can be allergic. The age of onset is generally between 6 months and 3 years. Signs are usually seasonal but may be seen all year. Itching is the most typical sign. The feet, face, ears, front legs, and abdomen are the most frequently affected areas, but scratching all over the body is common. Scratching can lead to secondary signs of wounds, scabbing, skin and ear infections, hair loss, and scaling. Other signs of atopy include licking or chewing the paws and rubbing the face and eyes. The skin is the main target of atopic dermatitis, but about 15% of affected dogs also develop inflammation inside the nose (rhinitis) and asthma. Longterm or recurrent ear infections may be the only sign in a small number of dogs."

Allergy vaccine (allergy shot) preparation involves selection of individual allergens for a particular dog. The allergen selection is determined by matching the test results with the prominent allergens during the time of year when the dog has signs. Immunotherapy can be administered as injections or as allergy drops. The dog must be cooperative enough to receive allergy injections or drops. If injections are used, you may have to administer some doses yourself. Your veterinarian can provide training and most owners learn to administer the allergy injections very well, while others may need assistance from a capable friend or veterinary staff member. Your veterinarian will determine the frequency of the treatments and the dosage given."

The ideal food elimination diet should be balanced and nutritionally complete and not contain any ingredients that have been fed previously to your dog. Owners often do not understand that if any previously fed ingredient is present in the elimination diet, the dog may be allergic to that one ingredient and the diet trial will be a failure. The key point in any food elimination diet trial is that only novel food ingredients can be fed. This also includes treats and anything the dog eats besides its regular food (including table food, flavored medications, and toothpaste). An alternative to an elimination diet is a prescription diet that contains hydrolyzed proteins. These proteins are broken down into components that your dog's body no longer recognizes. Whichever diet is chosen, dogs should only eat the food and treats recommended by their veterinarian during the duration of the trial."

The short hair shafts are easily forced backward into the hair follicles while the dog is walking. Ingrown hairs are very inflammatory in the skin, and secondary bacterial infections are common.

    "text": "The disease is caused by Dermatophilus congolensis bacteria. It is possible that the bacteria can live in the skin causing no signs in the animal until conditions encourage active infection. Outbreaks of dermatophilosis often occur during rainy seasons. In most short-term infections, the invasion of the skin stops in 2 to 3 weeks and the animal heals spontaneously. In longterm infections, the bacteria periodically spread from infected hair follicles and scabs to uninfected patches of skin. Increased wetness enhances the growth of the infective bacteria, leading to release of infective spores."

Because dermatophilosis usually heals rapidly and without complications, treatment is often not required. However, antibiotics can be used in painful or severely affected animals. The disease is controlled by isolating infected animals and controlling skin parasites that injure the skin and increase susceptibility to the bacteria. Keeping animals dry also helps. The condition can be passed to humans, so people should wear gloves and wash their hands after any contact with affected animals."

The disease may develop rapidly and can be painful. Large, swollen, red bumps develop most commonly on the muzzle but may also be seen on the head and around the eyes and ears. Diagnosis is typically made based on the appearance of the bumps, but biopsies may be done. Treatment consists of insect control, management of any associated allergies, antibiotics, and corticosteroids."

A single female flea can produce up to 50 eggs per day and about 2,000 in her lifetime. The eggs are pearly white, oval, and tiny. They readily fall from the fur and drop onto bedding, carpet, or soil, where they hatch in 1 to 6 days. Newly hatched flea larvae are mobile and free-living, feeding on organic debris found in their environment and on adult flea droppings. Flea larvae avoid direct light and actively move deep into carpet fibers or under organic debris (grass, branches, leaves, or soil)."

When it emerges from the cocoon, it can survive 1 to 2 weeks before finding a host on which to feed. It is the newly emerged, unfed fleas that infest pets and bite people. Fleas generally do not leave their host unless forced off by grooming or insecticides. Cat fleas in any stage of the life cycle cannot survive cold temperatures. They will die if the environmental temperature falls below 37°F (3°C) for several days."

Even nonallergic animals will scratch due to the annoyance of flea bites. Allergic dogs itch intensely in some or all areas of the body. They are likely to be restless and uncomfortable, spending much time scratching, licking, rubbing, chewing, and even nibbling at their skin. The classic clinical signs include crusted, itchy skin over the hips, base of the tail, and thighs. This often leads to hair loss, scabbing, and secondary infections. As the disease becomes chronic, hair loss, thickened skin, and darkening of skin color are seen. In heavy infestations (or in young puppies), anemia may develop due to the loss of blood."

    "text": "Most cases of flea allergy dermatitis occur in the late summer, corresponding to the peak of flea populations. Animals younger than 1 year old do not usually have flea allergy dermatitis. Generally, diagnosis is made by visual observation. Slowly parting the hair often reveals flea excrement or rapidly moving fleas. Flea excrement is reddish black, cylindrical, and pellet or comma-shaped. Placed in water or on a damp paper towel, the excrement dissolves, producing a reddish brown color. Extremely sensitive dogs are likely to be virtually free of fleas because of excessive self-grooming. In these cases, it is usually difficult to find evidence of fleas, thus making it harder to convince you that a flea allergy is the problem. Examination of the pet’s bedding for eggs, larvae, and excrement is also useful. The presence of fleas does not exclude another disease being at least partially responsible for the dog’s itching and skin condition. Your veterinarian may do skin testing to eliminate other causes for the itching and confirm a diagnosis of flea allergy dermatitis. Other conditions that can look like flea allergy dermatitis include respiratory allergies, food allergies, mange and other skin parasite infestations, and hair follicle infections."

The first step is to eliminate the existing fleas on the pet. This is necessary to reduce immediate pet discomfort. One common consideration is termed rate or speed of flea kill on a pet. However, it is important to differentiate between speed of elimination of fleas already on the pet and elimination of newly acquired fleas after a product has been applied. When treating a dog with a product applied to the skin externally, it can take up to 36 hours until the medication has spread sufficiently or reached sufficient concentrations to eliminate all existing fleas. If a more rapid rate of kill is needed, a flea spray or one of the new fast-acting oral products may be desirable."

In-home studies have shown that in many cases the newer topical and oral flea control products can effectively control flea populations without the need to treat the environment itself. By using these products, it is possible to eliminate a flea infestation in a household; however, the amount of time necessary to achieve flea control will vary because of the flea’s life cycle and conditions in the environment. Typically, control of an infestation can take 6 weeks to 3 months. In cases of massive flea infestation or severe pet or human flea allergy, treatment of the household environment may still be necessary. Wash pet blankets, throw rugs, and pet carriers. Vacuum areas where pets sleep, giving special attention to crevices in sofas and chairs and to areas beneath sofas or beds. Control may be achieved using insecticides with residual activity or by repeated application of short-acting products. Areas where flea eggs and larvae gather, such as bedding, furniture, carpets, the tiny spaces in hardwood flooring, behind baseboards, and within closets, should be treated. In severe infestations, a second treatment may be necessary 7–10 days later."

These tiny flies usually congregate around the eyes, though some species are attracted to the genital organs. They feed by sponging up mucus, pus, and blood. In the desert and foothill regions of southern California, adult flies are present throughout the year; they are most numerous from April through November. During the peak months, they are noticeable in the early morning and late afternoon. Often they are found in deep shade, among densely planted shrubs, or in the shade of a building."

Insect repellents, such as those recommended for mosquitoes, can provide temporary relief from eye gnats. Be sure to follow your veterinarian’s recommendations when using repellents. Community-wide mosquito control programs also reduce the number of eye gnats in the area. However, more adult gnats invade the area after the insecticide disperses."

They are swift fliers with powerful wings and very large eyes. The females may feed on the blood of any vertebrate animal, including dogs, though these flies usually prefer horses, deer, and cattle. Male flies are never blood feeders; instead they feed on plant nectar and pollen. Compared to other flies, they consume larger amounts of blood at a single feeding. Like other flies, they can transmit bacteria or viruses. Control of these flies is difficult. Some insecticides may be effective but may have to be used in different doses. Your veterinarian can advise you about the most effective products and dosages for your pet."

House flies, bot flies, blow flies, bottle flies, and flesh flies will lay eggs in skin wounds of any animal (including a dog) that has an infected skin wound. In newborn puppies, the healing stub of the umbilical cord is an attractive egg-laying site for flies. Bite wounds are often sites of initial infection in older dogs. Matted hair coats contaminated with feces also attract these flies. Eggs laid in contaminated hair coats produce maggots that move rapidly to any infected wound. Once inside a wound, the larvae quickly invade the surrounding tissue."

    "text": "A hygroma is a fluid-filled sac that develops over bony prominences and pressure points, especially in large breeds of dogs. Repeated trauma from lying on hard surfaces leads to inflammation. This results in a dense-walled, fluid-filled cavity. A soft, flexible, fluid-filled, painless swelling develops over pressure points, especially the elbow. If long lasting, severe inflammation may develop, with ulcers, infection, abscesses, granulomas (masses of inflamed tissue with sand-like deposits), and tissue erosion. The sac contains a clear fluid, yellow to red in color. If diagnosed early while they are still small, hygromas can be drained and then bandaged. Soft bedding and padding over pressure points is important to prevent further trauma. In cases of chronic hygromas, surgical drainage and flushing are critical for relief. Areas with severe skin ulcers may require extensive drainage, surgical removal, or skin grafting."

The most common causes of allergic itching are insect bites, food allergy, and a reaction to allergens in the environment, such as pollens, molds, or dust. Sensitivity to insect bites is readily identified by response to insect control. Dogs that have seasonal itching are likely reacting to seasonal allergens. Dogs with year-round allergic itching may have an environmental allergy (such as dust mite allergies) and/or a food allergy. Food allergy is confirmed or excluded based on response to a diet trial. During a diet trial your dog is fed a diet that does not include the foods it has normally consumed. Your veterinarian will specify a diet, often one containing fish or other meats not previously fed. To help your veterinarian isolate the food allergy, you will need to follow the prescribed diet fully and carefully and avoid providing treats that do not comply with the diet. Allergy testing and intradermal skin testing are also used to show antigen exposure patterns. These tests are used to determine the contents of an immunotherapy vaccine, but are ineffective in identifying food allergy."

The entire life cycle (17 to 21 days) of these mites is spent on the infested dog. Females burrow tunnels in the skin to lay eggs. Mange is easily spread between animals by contact. Indirect transmission, such as through infested bedding, is less common, but it can occur.

The itching is probably caused by sensitivity to the mites’ droppings. Initially, infested skin will erupt with small, solid bumps. Because the dog scratches or bites itself to relieve the itch, these bumps and the surrounding skin are often damaged, causing thick, crusted sores. Secondary yeast or bacterial infections can develop in the damaged skin. Usually, the sores appear first on the abdomen, chest, ears, elbows, and legs. If the mange is not diagnosed and treated, the sores can spread over the entire body. Dogs with longterm, recurring mange develop oily dandruff (seborrhea), severe thickening of the skin with wrinkling and crust build-up, and oozing, weeping sores. Dogs affected this severely can become emaciated and may even die."

    "text": "This form of mange is caused by Otodectes cynotis mites. These mites often infest the external ear, causing inflammation of the ear canal in dogs and especially in cats. Ear mites are usually found deep in the external ear canal, but they are sometimes seen on the body. The infested animal will shake its head and scratch its ear(s). In dogs with normally upright ears, the external ear may droop. The intensity of the itching varies and may be intense. In severe cases, the external ear may be inflamed and produce pus; a torn eardrum is also possible. Dogs with ear mites should be treated with a parasiticide in the ears or on the whole body. Your veterinarian will recommend an appropriate treatment plan that includes medication and ear cleaning instructions. Animals that have contact with infested dogs should also be treated."

Although these mites often stay on their preferred hosts, infections across species are possible. Walking dandruff is very contagious, especially in kennels, catteries, or multi-pet households. Regular use of certain insecticides to control flea infestations has a side benefit of often controlling the mites that cause walking dandruff. Humans can also be infested with these species of mites. Mites that cause walking dandruff spend their entire 3-week life cycle on their host but can also live up to 10 days in the environment."

Juvenile-onset generalized demodicosis is the result of an inherited immune system defect. On the other hand, adult-onset generalized demodicosis is often associated with an underlying disease that has suppressed the immune system (such as cancer, Cushing disease, hypothyroidism, or diabetes). Both types of generalized demodicosis can cause hair loss, reddened and swollen skin, increased pigmentation (darkening of the skin), raised lumps that look like acne, and scabs. Secondary bacterial infections (pyodemodicosis) are common. Many dogs with generalized demodicosis also have inflamed foot pads. Other signs can include enlarged lymph nodes, lethargy, fever, and pus-filled inflammation of the deeper layers of skin."

Secondary skin infections and fluid discharge are treated with standard wound management techniques. Exposure to flies must be prevented because the skin damage caused by photosensitivity attracts flies and may lead to maggot infestations and secondary diseases.

Pyoderma that occurs in otherwise healthy animals usually resolves completely with appropriate antibiotics. Warm, moist areas on the skin, such as lip folds, facial folds, armpits, feet, and neck folds, often have higher bacterial counts than other areas and are at an increased risk for infection. Pressure points, such as elbows, are prone to infections due to repeated pressure. Any skin disease that changes the normally dry, desert-like environment to a more humid environment can cause overcolonization of the skin with bacteria."

In dogs, superficial pyoderma commonly appears as bald patches, welts around hairs, and scabbing. Shorthaired breeds often have multiple welts that look similar to hives because the inflammation in and around the follicles causes the hairs to stand more erect. These hairs are often easily removed, which distinguishes pyoderma from hives. Hair loss leads to small bald patches in affected areas. At the margins of the hair loss, there may be redness and welts but these signs are often absent in shorthaired breeds. The signs of deep pyoderma in dogs include pain, crusting, odor, and secretions of blood and pus. Redness, swelling, ulceration, scabs, and blisters may also be seen. The bridge of the muzzle, chin, elbows, hocks, knees, and spaces between the toes are more prone to deep infections, but any area may be involved."

Broken hairs with associated spores are important sources for spread of the disease. Contact does not always result in infection. Whether infection is established depends on the fungal species and on host factors, including age, health, condition of exposed skin surfaces, grooming behavior, and nutrition. Infection leads to short-lived resistance to reinfection. Under most circumstances, dermatophytes grow only in the dead cells of skin and hair, and infection stops on reaching living cells or inflamed tissue. As inflammation and host immunity develop, further spread of infection stops, but this process may take several weeks."

Allergies are more likely to be the underlying cause if the age of onset is less than 5 years. Hormonal disorders are more likely if the seborrhea begins in middle aged or older dogs. A lack of itching helps to exclude allergies, scabies, and other itching diseases. If itching is minimal, your veterinarian will seek to exclude hormonal disorders, other internal diseases, or other primary skin diseases. If itching is significant, allergies, scabies, and fleas will also be considered by your veterinarian."

Keratolytic products include sulfur, salicylic acid, tar, selenium sulfide, propylene glycol, fatty acids, and benzoyl peroxide. They remove excess dead skin cells. This reduces the scale and makes the skin feel softer. Shampoos containing keratolytic products frequently increase scaling during the first 14 days of treatment, due to the loosened scales getting caught in the hair coat. The scales will be removed by continued bathing. Keratoplastic products help normalize keratinization and reduce scale formation. Tar, sulfur, salicylic acid, and selenium sulfide are examples of keratoplastic agents. Emollients (lactic acid, sodium lactate, lanolin, and numerous oils, such as corn, coconut, peanut, and cottonseed) reduce water loss from the skin. They work best after the skin has been rehydrated and are excellent products after shampooing. Antibacterial agents include benzoyl peroxide, chlorhexidine, iodine, ethyl lactate, tris-EDTA, and triclosan. Antifungal ingredients include chlorhexidine, sulfur, iodine, ketoconazole, and miconazole. Boric and acetic acids are also used as topical antibiotics. Most medicated shampoos are a combination of these ingredients."

    "text": "Keeping animals away from tick-prone areas is the most effective step you can take to control exposure. Most ticks live in particular microhabitats, such as tall grass or the border between wooded areas and lawns. Destruction of these microhabitats reduces the number of ticks. Removing tall grass and weeds and trimming vegetation can help protect your animal. Insecticide treatment of vegetation can slightly reduce the risk of ticks. However, it is not recommended for wide use because of environmental pollution and the cost of treatment of large areas."

Skin tumors are diagnosed more frequently than other tumors in animals in part because they are the most easily seen tumors and in part because the skin is constantly exposed to many tumor-causing factors in the environment. Chemicals, solar radiation, and viruses are just some of the things that can cause skin tumors. Hormonal abnormalities and genetic factors may also play a role in the development of skin tumors."

As the tumors grow, they may compress the rectum and induce constipation. Some of these tumors are associated with a syndrome that is characterized by abnormally high calcium in the blood. Elevated calcium causes poor appetite, weight loss, kidney disease, and increased water intake and urine output. The tumors often spread to local lymph nodes and other organs. In most cases, surgery requires removal of the mass and tissues surrounding it, including involved lymph nodes. If the entire tumor cannot be removed, reducing the size of the tumor can help improve signs. Chemotherapy and radiation treatment may also be provided. Few dogs live more than a year after this type of tumor has been diagnosed."

These growths are nests of tough, layered lumps that stick up from the skin surface. They can look a little like a horn, which is why they are described as cornifying. In other cases, the epitheliomas may appear solely as cornified cysts. They most likely arise from a hair follicle. These tumors can develop anywhere on the body, but they occur most frequently on the back, tail, and legs. Middle-aged dogs are most at risk. Norwegian Elkhounds, Belgian Sheepdogs, Lhasa Apsos, and Bearded Collies are most likely to develop these tumors. Norwegian Elkhounds and Lhasa Apsos are at risk for developing widespread tumors. The condition is diagnosed by finding the tumors on the animal. Treatment is optional, provided there is no self-trauma, ulceration, or secondary infection. Some dogs find the tumors annoying and attempt to scratch, rub, or bite them off. This leads to skin trauma that can easily become infected. Surgical removal is the treatment of choice. However, dogs are prone to develop additional tumors. For animals with a generalized form of the disease, oral retinoid medications may help."

Canine histiocytomas are normally considered benign tumors; most resolve spontaneously and without treatment within 2 to 3 months. Surgical removal is optional and normally performed only if the tumors cause severe problems for the dog."

It is rare in dogs and can develop at any age but is most common in young adults. Chinese Shar Peis, Collies, Border Collies, Shetland Sheepdogs, Briards, Bernese Mountain Dogs, Golden Retrievers, and German Shepherds may have a higher risk of disease. The skin bumps may come and go and do not typically cause itching. The legs and trunk are most commonly affected. The disease can also affect the face and can cause trouble breathing if present on the nostrils. This form of histiocytosis does not typically affect any internal organs but can cause dogs to appear unsightly. A number of therapies have been tried to treat this condition, but the response is variable. Some dogs will respond rapidly and permanently, whereas others will only improve temporarily, if at all."

Systemic histiocytosis of Bernese Mountain dogs is an aggressive skin disease that causes multiple skin lesions that wax and wane. The disease tends to become more severe with each new wave of eruptions. Skin bumps develop across the skin (especially on the scrotum of males), inside the nose, and on the eyelids. Although the skin masses may resolve, they usually recur several months later. Masses may also develop in internal organs, such as the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. The disease eventually becomes progressive and results in death. Chemotherapy and other drugs may be used to treat systemic histiocytosis."

There are several kinds of keratinized skin cysts, each of which affect a different part of the hair follicle. The ones found in dogs include infundibular follicular cysts, isthmus catagen cysts, matrix cysts, hybrid cysts (panfollicular cysts), and dermoid cysts. Dermoid cysts are congenital (the animal is born with them). Among dogs, they are most commonly found in Boxers, Kerry Blue Terriers, and Rhodesian Ridgebacks. Most dermoid cysts are multiple and contain fully formed hair shafts. Diagnosis is by finding the cysts on the dog. They can be solitary or multiple and are benign. Surgical removal is the best treatment. You should not to attempt to remove the cysts by squeezing them because this can spread the cyst contents into the surrounding tissues. Your dog’s body will react to the cyst contents as a foreign substance, which can cause severe inflammation."

Diagnosis is by finding the tumors on the animal and confirming the type of tumor with a fine needle aspiration or a biopsy. Most of these tumors do not spread and surgical removal is the usual treatment. When these tumors develop in the mouth, they may multiply. Treatment for the multiple form is more difficult, because the tumors are more likely to return following surgery. In such cases, tissue around the tumors may have to be removed. When tumors are multiple, or surgical removal is not feasible, radiation treatment is considered. Chemotherapy is commonly recommended for patients if radiation treatment is declined or if the tumor is resistant to radiation treatment."

    "text": "Mast cell tumors are named for the type of cell from which they grow. Mast cells are involved in allergic reactions. They release histamine, which causes irritation and itching, and other chemicals that may cause shock. Mast cell tumors are the most common malignant tumor seen in dogs. They may be seen in dogs of any age but occur most commonly in dogs 8 to 10 years old. They may develop anywhere on the body surface as well as in internal organs, but the limbs (especially the back of the upper thigh), lower abdomen, and chest are the most common sites. In about 10% of cases, tumors are found in multiple locations. Tumor size at the time of surgery often predicts the outcome; tumors larger than 1¼ inches (3 cm) are associated with decreased survival time. Tumors located near mucous membranes, feet, prepuce, or on the lower surface of the body are more likely to spread than mast cell tumors in other areas. Tumors that grow rapidly or that are not removed completely during surgery are also more likely to spread. Many breeds appear to be prone to the disease, especially Boxers and Pugs (in which tumors are often multiple), Rhodesian Ridgebacks, and Boston Terriers."

Most commonly, a mast cell tumor appears as a raised lump or mass that may be soft to solid to the touch. Mast cell tumors are tricky and difficult to deal with because they appear as a large central tumor but are in fact surrounded by a halo of smaller, microscopic nests of mast cells that infiltrate normal-looking skin. Dogs can also develop signs associated with the release of toxins from the malignant mast cells. For example, up to a quarter of dogs with mast cell tumors also have stomach ulcers due to histamine release. Diagnosis is by microscopic examination of tumor samples obtained by fine needle aspirations, impression smears, or biopsy samples."

    "text": "Small mast cell tumors may remain quiet and seem inactive for long periods before spreading. Other tumors can be aggressive and spread rapidly. Thus, all mast cell tumors are normally treated as at least potential malignancies. Treatment depends on the clinical stage of the disease and the predicted spread of an individual tumor. For a small solitary tumor confined to the skin (Stage I), the preferred treatment is complete surgical removal. Most veterinarians will remove at least 1¼ inches (3 centimeters) of healthy tissue surrounding all borders of these tumors to remove both the lump and any surrounding nests of tumor cells. If, during surgery, biopsy of a sample of the removed tissue suggests that the tumor extends beyond the initial edge of the surgery, additional surrounding tissue will be removed. Alternatively, because mast cells are sensitive to radiation, radiation treatment may be effective if there is remaining tumor. In some cases, a combination of radiation treatment, chemotherapy at the tumor location, and hyperthermia of the site (carefully increasing the body temperature of the affected area while under anesthesia) may be more effective than radiation alone. If the margins are not clean and radiation treatment is not elected, chemotherapy is also an effective followup treatment. Some dogs grow new tumors periodically. When surgery is not performed for residual disease or for small recurrent tumors, injections of steroids and antihistamines into the tumor, which may be followed by freezing (cryotherapy), can be considered as an option."

This is necessary because there is a strong possibility that the sarcoma has spread beyond the mass into surrounding tissues that appear normal. Occasionally, depending on location, amputation may be required to remove the entire tumor. It is important to remove all of the tumor during the first surgery, because sarcomas that recur have a greater potential to invade local tissue, and they may also spread to other parts of the body. Each future attempt at surgical removal can increase the rate of spread. Freezing (cryosurgery) is usually not used for sarcomas because some tumor types are resistant to freezing. Spindle-cell sarcomas generally do not respond well to conventional doses of radiation. Higher doses have been somewhat successful. Surgical removal followed by radiation is an option, as well as radiation prior to surgical removal. Chemotherapy for sarcomas has become a more common method of treatment. Although chemotherapy may improve the quality and prolong the life of an affected dog, it is seldom a complete cure. There is only a guarded outlook for dogs with soft-tissue sarcomas."

Gordon Setters, Irish Wolfhounds, Brittany Spaniels, Golden Retrievers, and Doberman Pinschers are most likely to develop these tumors. Fibrosarcomas vary greatly in appearance and size. Tumors arising under the skin surface may look lumpy. Those arising in the fat or nearby soft tissues may require hands-on examination to detect. They are firm and fleshy and appear deep in the skin and the fat underneath. They often invade underlying muscles. When multiple tumors are present, they usually occur within the same area of the body. In dogs, fibrosarcomas are invasive tumors that spread into surrounding tissues; only about 10% of these tumors spread to other parts of the body (metastasize). Wide and deep surgical removal is the best treatment, although complete removal is difficult. Because it is hard to determine the tumor’s edges during surgery, recurrence is common (more than 70% return within 1 year of the initial surgery). Even when surgical removal is complete, recurrence is still the rule. Followup radiation treatment and chemotherapy has been recommended after surgery, for tumors that are inoperable, and for tumors that cannot be removed completely. Your veterinarian may refer you to a veterinary cancer specialist for the treatment of these tumors."

Two forms occur in dogs—skin and subungual. Skin squamous cell carcinomas are tumors of older dogs. Bloodhounds, Basset Hounds, and Standard Poodles are at greatest risk. They appear on the head, lower legs, abdomen, and rear. Most appear as firm, raised, frequently ulcerated patches and lumps. Sometimes they can grow outward with a surface like a wart. Some are caused by prolonged sun exposure. These usually develop on the lower abdomen, especially on or near the pubic area in white-skinned, shorthaired breeds such as Dalmatians, Pit Bull Terriers, Bull Terriers, and Beagles. They develop on the underside of dogs because the poorly haired skin offers minimal shielding from ultraviolet radiation. Many animals sun themselves lying on their backs. They also get some solar radiation that reflects from the ground. Before a malignant tumor develops, dogs develop solar keratosis. Solar keratosis is thickened and discolored skin. Thus, finding areas on your dog where the skin is thick and discolored is cause for a veterinary checkup. Early diagnosis is important for successful treatment."

These tumors usually invade into surrounding tissues. Some tumors grow slowly, whereas others are more likely to spread or return within 20 weeks of surgical removal. In general, when treatment fails it is due to late diagnosis and lack of control of the original tumor rather than spread of new tumors.

Although the appearance is variable, the tumors that spread to the skin are usually multiple, ulcerated lumps. As these tumors grow, they extend deeper into the skin and surrounding tissue. Generally, it is difficult to identify the primary tumor based on the signs in the skin. This is because only a small population of cells in the primary tumor will spread to the skin, and these cells may have different microscopic features than the primary tumor. When tumors have spread from other areas of the body to the skin, the primary tumor usually grows and spreads quickly and the outlook for a positive outcome is guarded to poor. Treatment for these tumors involves a whole-body approach that deal with both the skin tumors and the primary tumor(s)."

    "text": "Warts will eventually go away on their own, although how long this takes varies considerably. A variety of treatments have been suggested, but results vary. Surgical removal is recommended if the warts are sufficiently objectionable. However, because surgery in the early growing stage of warts may lead to recurrence and stimulation of growth, the warts should be removed when near their maximal size or when regressing. Affected dogs may be isolated from susceptible ones, but with the long incubation period (months), many are likely to have been exposed before the problem is recognized. Your veterinarian may recommend medications to help the immune system eliminate your dog's warts."

Thus, it can persist for a long time within or on a contaminated environment or object. Livestock may consume the spores while grazing; however, the most common source of infection in dogs is from raw or poorly cooked contaminated meat or contact with the blood, tissues, or body fluids of infected animals that harbor spores. Although the inhalation of anthrax spores is a concern in humans, the dog appears to be quite resistant to infection by this route of exposure. A skin form of anthrax exists in humans, but this route is also thought to be of minimal significance in dogs."

Because anthrax spores are resistant to many disinfectants, check with a health official as to proper decontamination procedures."

Anthrax is not directly communicable by usual social contact from one infected animal to another animal, between animal and person, or person to person, even in the case of anthrax pneumonia. For infection to occur, spores must gain access to the new victim by ingestion, inhalation, or through open wounds. When transmission occurs between individuals it is usually through exposure to infected tissue or body fluids. Therefore, people should use strict precautions (wearing gloves, protective clothing, goggles, and masks) when handling potentially infected animals or their remains. If a person has inhaled anthrax, preventive treatments are available. In addition, people who have eaten raw or undercooked meats that were contaminated with anthrax may require preventive treatments."

Aspergillus tereus, Aspergillus deflectus, and Aspergillus niger are the most common species of organism responsible. The fungus likely enters through the respiratory tract and goes to the lungs, then travels through the bloodstream where it spreads throughout the body, including the intervertebral discs of the spine or the kidneys. Other organs, muscles, or bones may also be affected."

Signs of this disease may include neurologic signs, such as back pain progressing to partial or complete paralysis or lameness of a limb with pronounced swelling. Other, less specific, findings include poor appetite, weight loss, muscle wasting, fever, weakness, lethargy, limping, vomiting, blood in the urine, urinary accidents, and lymph node enlargement. Severely ill dogs have a poor prognosis. Most dogs die from the disseminated aspergillosis although a few have been treated successfully."

Infections are limited to dry, desert-like regions of the southwestern United States and the valleys of southern California. Similar geographic areas of Mexico and Central and South America are also affected. While many species of animals, including humans, are susceptible, only dogs are affected significantly. Inhalation of fungal spores (often carried on dust particles) is the only established mode of infection. Epidemics may occur when rainy periods are followed by drought, resulting in dust storms. Coccidioidomycosis is primarily a chronic respiratory disease, but canine infections can spread throughout the dog’s body infecting many tissues, especially eyes, joints, and bone. Signs can vary greatly, depending on which organs are involved and the severity of infection. Dogs with disseminated disease may have a persistent cough, poor appetite, general ill health and malnutrition, lameness, enlarged joints, fever, and intermittent diarrhea. The skin may become ulcerated. Many dogs exposed to the fungal spores will fight off the infection without showing any signs at all."

However, if chronic respiratory signs occur or the infection involves many body organs and tissues, longterm antifungal treatment is needed. In cases where the infection has spread, treatment of at least 6 to 12 months is typical. With treatment, the likelihood of recovery from the primary (respiratory) form is quite good. Recovery in the disseminated case varies with the location and severity, and must be considered guarded. There is no known prevention other than decreasing your pet’s exposure to desert soil and dust in areas where the fungus occurs."

    "text": "The diagnosis of lagenidiosis and pythiosis is made with laboratory tests including cultures and blood tests. The treatment of choice for pythiosis and lagenidiosis has been aggressive surgery to remove infected tissue, but the disease is often too extensive at the time of diagnosis to allow complete removal. Whenever possible, complete amputation of affected limbs may be curative. Your veterinarian may recommend surgery followed by treatment with antifungal drugs. Approximately 20% of dogs will respond to longterm antifungal treatment. For most infections the outlook is guarded to poor, even though there have been advances in treatment. In some dogs, a therapeutic vaccine (one given to treat a disease rather than prevent it) has helped cure the condition."

If the fever lasts for more than 1 day, other signs of illness, such as an increased heart rate, develop. On the day after the initial temperature rise, the white blood cell count drops and stays low throughout the feverish period. Clotting abnormalities can result in spontaneous bleeding that can be hard to control. The severity of the clotting problem seems to relate to the severity of the infection. Other signs of infection include apathy, loss of appetite, thirst, inflammation of the eyes, and a watery discharge from the eyes and nose. Occasionally there may be abdominal pain and vomiting. The nose and mouth may be reddened or covered with small bruises. Enlarged tonsils and swelling of the head, neck, and trunk may occur."

Topical insecticides against sand flies are critical for dogs that live in areas where leishmaniasis is common, dogs traveling to these regions, and infected dogs (to reduce likelihood of transmission). In areas where the disease is common, rapid treatment of infected dogs, control of stray and homeless dogs, and control of sand flies are recommended.

Once in the body, leptospires spread rapidly via the lymph system to the bloodstream and then to all tissues. If the animal mounts an immune response and survives, leptospires will be cleared from most organs and the bloodstream. However, the infection persists in sites hidden from the immune system; the most common hidden sites are the kidneys and reproductive tract. Persistence in these organs results in a carrier state; the infected animal may shed leptospires in the urine and genital secretions for months to years."

    "text": "Because leptospirosis can be transmitted to people, any caretakers should take appropriate precautions when handling known or suspected infected animals. Pay particular attention to avoiding exposure of skin or mucous membranes to urine or blood. Infected dogs should be allowed to urinate only in designated areas that can subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. The organisms are killed by all commonly used disinfectants. If your dog was recently diagnosed with leptospirosis, you should contact your physician with any health concerns. You should also wear gloves when cleaning up urine and should wash your hands after handling your dog, at least until antibiotic treatment is completed."

    "text": "Lyme disease, which is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria and transmitted through the bite of a tick, affects domestic animals (dogs, horses, and possibly cats) and humans. At least 4 known species of ticks can transmit Lyme disease. However, the great majority of Lyme disease transmissions are due to the bite of a very tiny tick commonly called the deer tick, or black-legged tick. The scientific name of the tick involved on the west coast is Ixodes pacificus and Ixodes scapularis in the northeast and Midwest. Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes persulcatus are the primary vectors in Europe and Asia. It is important to note that ticks themselves do not cause Lyme disease; they harbor and transmit the bacteria that cause it."

    "text": "Although the tick prefers certain creatures—such as voles, white-footed mice, or deer—upon which to feed during the various stages of its life cycle, it is quite willing to feed on people or dogs. Regardless of its stage of development (larva, nymph, or adult Ixodes tick), if the tick carries the bacteria in its body, people and dogs can become infected if bitten. Once a tick attaches, it takes 1-2 days for it to transmit the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, so prompt removal of ticks is important. Risk of transmission is highest during periods when the nymphs (spring) and adults (spring and fall) are actively seeking hosts."

Infection rates of ticks vary, but can be as high as 50%. Areas in the United States where it occurs most often include the northeast (especially the New England states), upper Midwest, and Pacific coast. The disease is actually named after the town Lyme, Connecticut, where an early outbreak was first described. Lyme disease is also seen in Europe and Asia. The risk of Lyme disease being transmitted to people is increasing. In the last 20 years, the number of cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control has about doubled, to around 30,000/year. Although the rate of occurrence of the disease in a geographic area is similar in both animals and people, animals, especially dogs, are at significantly higher risk because of their greater exposure to ticks."

Vaccines that prevent infection in dogs are available; these appear to work best when given to dogs before they are exposed to Lyme-causing bacteria. Vaccination and appropriate boosters may be recommended by your veterinarian if you live in an area where Lyme disease is common. Any ticks found on your dog should be promptly removed in order to help prevent transmission of Lyme disease and other diseases spread by ticks. Dogs are not the direct source of infection in people. Pets may bring unattached infected ticks into the household and if they then attach to another animal or person, they may transmit Lyme disease."

The spotted-fever group of organisms is found worldwide, but the closely related organisms within this group that cause Rocky Mountain spotted fever are only found in certain geographic areas of North, South, and Central America. They are often transmitted through the bites of infected ticks. In the United States, the American dog tick and the Rocky Mountain wood tick are considered the most important transmission agents for Rickettsia rickettsii. The brown dog tick also transmits the disease in some parts of the country (including Arizona) and in other countries."

Remove any ticks by using fine-pointed tweezers to grasp the head of the tick (right where it enters the skin). Pull the tick straight off, making sure not to grasp or squeeze its body. If there are multiple ticks, it may be best to have your veterinarian remove them and examine your dog.

General stiffness becomes pronounced about 1 day later, and then spasms and painful sensitivity to touch become evident. Spasms are often triggered by sudden movement or noise. Because of their high resistance to tetanus toxin, dogs often have a long incubation period and frequently develop tetanus that is localized to the area of the wound, such as stiffness and rigidity in the limb with a wound. The stiffness can spread to the opposite leg then progress toward the head. When generalized tetanus does develop, the ears are erect, the tail is stiff and extended, and the mouth is partially open with the lips drawn back."

In some areas of the world, as much as 60% of the human population has antibodies to the organism and are likely to be persistently infected. Toxoplasmosis is a major concern for people with weakened immune systems. In these individuals, toxoplasmosis usually affects the nervous system and results from the emergence of T gondii from tissue cysts located in the brain as immunity wanes rather than from primary T gondii infection. Toxoplasmosis is also a concern for pregnant women because the organism can migrate across the placenta and cause birth defects. Infection may occur after eating undercooked meat or accidental consumption of cysts from cat feces. To prevent infection, people handling meat should wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water after contact, and also thoroughly wash all cutting boards, sink tops, knives, and other materials. The organism present in meat is killed by contact with soap and water. They can also be killed by exposure to extreme cold or heat. Tissue cysts in meat are killed by heating the meat throughout to 67°C (152.6°F) or by cooling to −13°C (8.6°F). Toxoplasma in tissue cysts are also killed by exposure to gamma irradiation. Meat of any animal should be cooked to 67°C (152.6°F) before consumption, and tasting meat while cooking or while seasoning should be avoided. Pregnant women should avoid contact with cat litter, soil, and raw meat. Pet cats should be fed only dry, canned, or cooked food. The cat litter box should be emptied daily, preferably not by a pregnant woman. Gloves should be worn while gardening. Vegetables should be washed thoroughly before eating, because they may have been contaminated with cat feces."

Disease resulting from Type B infection is generally mild and occurs most commonly as a result of contact with arthropods (ticks, fleas, or flies) that spread the disease or ingestion of contaminated water in North America and Eurasia. Type C is the least common and least severe type of tularemia."

    "text": "In domestic animals, sheep are infected most frequently, but infection has been reported in dogs, cats, pigs, and horses. It is possible that many mild cases go untreated and unreported among pets and livestock. Infection occurs most commonly in cottontail and jackrabbits, beaver, muskrat, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia. Although found in every state except Hawaii, tularemia is most often reported in the south central and western US (California, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana). Dogs appear to be relatively resistant to the bacteria, and infections in dogs are rare."

    "text": "The disease can be transmitted from animals to people by several routes. The most common mode of transmission to people is from the bite of an infected tick. Direct transmission can occur from contact with moist tissue when skinning and preparing wild game. Inhalation of organisms in the air can cause disease in the lungs. Other sources of infection include eating infected, undercooked game and drinking contaminated water. Rarely, the bite of a cat that has recently fed on an infected animal has been found to be a source of human infection."

    "text": "In most mammals, signs of illness may include tick infestation, swollen glands, the sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, and poor appetite. Other signs may include stiffness and reduced mobility and are associated with a generalized infection. Pulse and respiratory rates may also be increased, and the infected animal may have a cough, diarrhea, and frequent urination. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Very mild cases without signs may be common."

Control is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Animals that recover develop a long-lasting immunity."
